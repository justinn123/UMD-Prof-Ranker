"""He is impossible to understand. He speaks very quietly, has a thick accent, and is overall a poor lecturer. Lecture is awful, and the majority of the learning in this class is done on your own or in discussion. I had an excellent TA which made discussion tolerable, but I've heard from friends in other sections that several of his TA's are not good.

Grading-wise, this class isn't difficult. Weekly quizzes are usually taken directly from homework problems, and the exams were basically mirror images of the practice exams we were given."""|1

"""You should take this class with anyone else. Seriously. Dolgopyat is the worst lecturer I have had to date in any class. He makes this class far more confusing than it has to be in lecture; the material itself isn't difficult. It's just probabilities, means, and standard deviations, but Dmitri will give you overly complicated formulas and actively confuse you. That's not to mention that he lectures through a thick accent and monotone mumbling, so he is very hard to understand or pay attention to. We're halfway into the semester, and only 30 kids show up to the 200 person lecture anyone because the lecture is almost useless. If you have this class with him, you are better off teaching the material to yourself or with friends on your own time than going to lecture."""|2

"""The review below does a good job of highlighting the fact that he does not speak clearly at all. His accent and his tendency to speak very softly makes it extremely hard to understand anything he's saying. This translates into being a very poor professor overall, and he tends to go over the problems, so fast that going to the lectures accomplishes literally nothing. Most of the class ends up just studying the entire course out of the book since he does not help at all. The weekly quizzes are 40% of your overall grade, which means if you have a bad TA who does not speak english then you are screwed. I would say that Prof. Dolgopyat is not a good professor for this course, and he does not curve since he does not care about his students one bit. Try to take this course with someone else besides him; this class will be much easier with anyone else."""|1

"""Though Prof. Dolgopyat is not the best lecturer (he tends to speak very fast or very low) he does make up for it by providing a wide array of problems, and goes over each one thoroughly. Most people in the class earned an A with a couple almost failing because they were a little too cocky (ppl who scored A's on exams) and decided not to do the HW (worth 25% of grade). He did give them a pass but I don't know if he will do that in the future. All in all three exams and HW is not much to stress a person out but be warned, if you can't follow what the prof is writing on the board without listening to them explain it then you will not fair well in his class.

"""He appears to be very knowledgeable about his subject, however he is not a very good teacher and is frankly a very poor lecturer.  Much of the lecture is spent with him progressing rather quickly and confusingly through highly complex mathematical proofs for various statistical equations that are completely unnecessary to understand the content of the course, thus resigning his students to an annoying state of frustration at being more confused at the end than they were at the beginning.  Most of the material is relatively simple to understand if taught well, primarily consisting of calculating probabilities and working with a couple of different statistical distributions based on their means and standard deviations; however he makes everything so much more complicated and harder to understand when it does not need to be that way.  On top of this, he has an incredibly thick accent and the tendency to speak progressively softer as if he is fading away from reality into the cloudy mathematical recesses of his brain.

"""I just want to make something very clear first: Dmitry is clearly a brilliant man and knows what he's talking about... He's just not a very good lecturer.

If you're going to take this class, I hope to you're comfortable with reading chapters out of a textbook to teach yourself, because that's all your semester will consist of. I stopped going to his lectures because I realized that teaching myself the material from the textbook was genuinely a more productive use of my time.

Dmitry's midterm study material (practice exams) are a 50/50 when it comes to how similar they are to the actual exams (first midterm -- actual exam was easier than practice; second midterm -- actual exam was on par with practice in my opinion), so it's stressful to try and figure out whether it's over for you or not, while doing the practice exams. 

I'm the type of person to find the positive in every terrible situation, so I'll try to do the same here. You get weekly homework assigned to you on Webassign, and honestly, I'm always able to knock those out within around 1.5 to 2 hours, and the problems are straightforward enough such that you're able to read the textbook and (mostly) know what to do. Not only that, if you genuinely and honestly do well on the homework assignments, the weekly quizzes are easy, since they're pulled straight from the homework (albeit with different numbers).

Yeah, that's it... Whoever you are reading this, if you're like me and took this class due to lack of openings in other sections, I wish you the best, and I believe in you :)

If you're reading this and you have other options for professors, please please please take them instead."""|1

"""I feel that Professor Dolgopyat gets a bad rap sometimes from students who never attended lecture beyond the first week. After the first week, only the first two rows are filled consistently. But if you genuinely try your hardest to understand what he's teaching, you will be ok. It will be difficult, and you have to put in some hefty work on your own, but actually attending lectures really helps. Professor Dolgopyat runs through examples, and his medterms were always easier than the crazy-hard sample midterms he gave out, so I always felt prepared. His grading is very lenient too, with him dropping your two lowest quiz grades. Quizzes are based on that week's homework, so you know to expect 1 of 10 questions, and can study accordingly. Overall, not a terrible class. Give Professor Dolgopyat a chance, and you can survive this class."""|3

"""If you enjoy illegible handwriting, unintelligible rambling in a heavy Russian accent, then this class is for you. While in lecture I spent more time trying to decipher his hieroglyphics on the board than actually learning anything stat related.

The homework and quizzes are also entirely separate from the midterms and final, which are also separate from the lectures. The textbook is not the best either, although my TA was very helpful.

"""He is not the best lecturer as the other reviews say. The worksheets he posts usually have errors in the solutions and you have to ask on Piazza whether the mistake is in the worksheet or something that you did wrong. The material isn't too bad, but it piles up on you quick. Now, I did come in having taken AP Stats so a couple of the topics towards the end of the course were familiar to me that wouldn't be familiar to people who haven't taken AP stats. In terms of grades, there is a weekly webassign that all together is worth 10%. There are weekly quizzes where they choose a random question from the previous webassign and all together is worth 30%. Additionally he drops the lowest two quizzes and homeworks. Three exams(2 midterms and 1 final) are all worth 20%, and in my opinion, significantly easier than the stuff we do in class. I would recommend finding a study group for the exams, and doing all the practice problems he assigns. If you do that, the midterms should be fine and you'll end with a decent grade in the class. However, if you don't have much experience with statistics, you'd be better off with a different professor."""|3

The homework and weekly quizzes in the discussion, which are closely aligned
The exams which he gives you a review sheet for (that are pretty close to the exams themselves)

"""So Professor Dolgopyat is very knowledgeable and approachable, but is just not the best teacher. This class ended being a lot more stressful than I believe it should have been. The concepts, if relayed well, are fairly straightforward. The issue is that his lectures are often confusing. He does do examples, but often not to the extent as would be helpful. I had to put in a lottt of work to do well on the exams. I went to office hours, asked questions, and more. He is very willing to help if you go to office hours. If you don't want to read all this lol here is a quick pros/cons list:

Pros: 
- weekly quiz is always 1 question exactly from the Webassign hw 
- sample problems for exams are good practice but are usually super hard, but... actual exams ended up being more straightforward
- drops 2 lowest quizzes
- TA's were livesavers answering questions on Piazza
- final exam is same weight as regular midterms
- he creates chapter summaries before exams and posts quiz and exam solutions on ELMS afterwards

Cons:
- confusing lectures
- sample exam problems are super different than the Webassign hw's and usually very hard. they always had problems out of left-field that we had seen no examples for. some of these problems my TA didn't even know how to do at first. also there are often lots of errors in the answer keys for these sample problems. 

Overall, if you can get another professor I would recommend doing so. However, this class with Dmitry is doable if you are committed to putting in a lot of effort."""|3

Don't be fooled by the people are saying that he wasn't that bad. He's absolutely horrendous. He couldn't teach if his life depended on it. Like people have pointed out, you will learn nothing in lecture, you just have to teach yourself. Since I do best by mostly learning by instruction, I am about to fail this class. Usually, I take responsibility for not performing well, but honestly, it's not on me at this point for this class. And I know some will say, """"well its college in the real world nobody will hold your hand"""", to which my response is to shut up because I'm paying money to learn here, not to just skip lecture because it's a waste of time. This professor is a good example of increasing tuition costs but the decreasing educational standards we get. It's clear that UMD isn't paying this man enough to care about his class, as if you do see his lectures, he will literally go at his own pace as if he's just reviewing the information to himself. And that's if you can understand him.

If you need some sort of instruction and want to go to UMD to actually learn, like me (and most students), I'd stay away from this class. His exams are easier than his practice exams, but his practice exams are very sloppily done. He posts the solutions, where there's spelling and arithmetic errors everywhere, and formulas are pulled out of nowhere. What he needs to do is get himself (or preferably a TA) to go through each question in the practice exam solutions, and record it. The actual questions are just so difficult and combined with his sloppiness in writing the solutions, it's just not good. Like I said, its a testament to how he's simply not getting paid enough to care.

Also, no curving will be done at all, and don't listen to the responses who say his exams and practice exams are """"mirror image copies"""" they are different and dont always test the same stuff. The quizzes are a lot more similar however.

Over all, stay away, unless you're fine with teaching yourself and deciphering his practice exam solutions."""|1

"""When I signed up for this professor, I was confident that his accent would not be an issue, and it wasn't. There are many other issues, however.
1) He talks too quietly and too fast. I sat in the front row every single class, and I still couldn't hear a word he said. He only directed his lecture at two people on the right side of the lecture hall.
2) He goes into detail on proofs and details that don't matter. If you're a CS student, you know that STAT400 is not supposed to be hard. In fact, your peers who took the other professors can attest to that fact. Professor Dolgopyat loves to go into detail about the theory of statistics, and if you actually care, that's great. But, be warned that you still won't understand the topics any better.
3) He releases practice problems that stress out the whole class and doesn't go over all the worksheet problems that are actually related to the exam.

"When I signed up for this professor, I was confident that his accent would not be an issue, and it wasn't. There are many other issues, however.
1) He talks too quietly and too fast. I sat in the front row every single class, and I still couldn't hear a word he said. He only directed his lecture at two people on the right side of the lecture hall.
2) He goes into detail on proofs and details that don't matter. If you're a CS student, you know that STAT400 is not supposed to be hard. In fact, your peers who took the other professors can attest to that fact. Professor Dolgopyat loves to go into detail about the theory of statistics, and if you actually care, that's great. But, be warned that you still won't understand the topics any better.
3) He releases practice problems that stress out the whole class and doesn't go over all the worksheet problems that are actually related to the exam. 
4) He DOESN'T CURVE.
If you do take this professor, be prepared to diligently read the textbook and complete the worksheets he posts daily. On the first exam I got a C because I only focused on the practice midterm problems he posted and that was a mistake. Good luck!"|1
"""Smart guy but you can really tell he's not comfortable/doesn't want to teach this class in particular. First day of classes he seemed really uncomfortable and a number of students brought up the fact that they were unable to hear him within the first half of class.

As the semester progressed it became clear that lecture was pretty useless as I couldn't hear or understand what he was saying. Although his provided sample questions were relevant to exam questions, they were riddled with typos and occasionally were missing necessary information. Even worse, the included solutions had numerous mathematical errors and steps were not adequately explained. Thankfully, the actual exam questions were free of any serious errors, but typos were still present.

"""I had Dmitry for STAT400, and it was definitely harder than what my friends said the other professors were like. However, it was far from impossible. 

My advice:
1. Attend lecture, sit in the front row, and try to follow along as best as you can. This is helpful especially before the tests, because he will often give hints about what will be on them and what to focus on. I find that a lot of the people complaining about Dmitry barely ever went to lecture.... and it doesn't usually turn out well for them. 
2. Before class, I always read the textbook section, which made following along with him during lecture a lot easier. 
3. Make sure you understand the homework, since the quizzes are on questions from the homework. If you understand the homework, the quizzes (which are ~30% of your grade) are basically a free grade boost.
4. Make at least one friend in the class, and you can work through the practice problems/homeworks/study together. 

Some other notes:
Dmitry is very generous with grading -- people say he doesn't curve, however 95% and above is an A+, and he drops the 2 worst quizzes out of your 10-11 quiz scores. His practice problems are hard, but they prepare you for the test very well because the tests are FAR easier. Dmitry will never throw you a curveball on any test -- they are all very fair and reasonable. On the tests themselves, he gives generous amounts of partial credit if you show your work or even so much as just explain what you would do/your thinking. 

Dmitry is very passionate about statistics, although he isn't the best at teaching, especially to beginners. I think this is partially because he is extremely intelligent about the subject. But, people are super dramatic about the difficulty of this class. I am no math genius, but with a little bit of work, I was able to comfortably get a good grade.

Also, he is a lovely person. And he's written several books! Cool!!!!"""|5

PROS:
-Very detailed and course oriented. Almost never goes off on tangents.
-Likes to use funny analogies to explain concepts in class, which helped me remember more clearly.
-Projects were fair and were more practical than the ones I did last semester for 131.
-Exams were generally easy, and stuck to the practice problems he posts on ELMS.
-His obsession with koalas is hilarious.

CONS:

-Tends to be abrasive and mean in class sometimes. God help you if he catches you with your phone more than once.
-Typically doesn't fully answer questions from people in lecture because he claims he needs to rush through material, leaving people even more confused sometimes.
-Not exactly the most approachable  or nicest person around, which might discourage people from going to office hours.

"""I’ve only taken 2 comp sci classes at Maryland but I definitely learned a lot from Mr. Herman. Starting with the cons:

Mr. Herman means well but seems to lack skill in social interaction (unless he is disciplining someone). He never seemed to want to look me in the eye when I tried to ask him questions before or after lecture, and talks like a robot at times. He is not the greatest lecturer: he repeats himself often and kept saying that he was """"behind"""" for the last 5 weeks or so of the semester. During that time he didn't really ask if there were questions on the new material, but is very responsive if you go to his office hours or ask for help outside of class. Very strict about the """"No laptops or electronics"""" policy...he kicks people out of class for texting during lecture. I think he got his count up to 20 between two of his three lecture periods when I was in 132 with him. 

Switching gears though, Mr. Herman is very knowledgeable about Java and the computer programming paradigm. His lecture slides are an amazing resource, sometimes better than the textbook (which, for 132, I highly recommend you get, even if you’re a Java expert, as it contains a lot of powerful concepts and goes into detail on some foggy areas beyond the 132 curriculum that are still good to know)."""|3

"""I would like to start off by saying that Herman is not as bad as many people say. I feel that most of the low reviews he gets are from freshmen who are not prepared for the amount of work this class will take. With that being said, I will give you as honest a review of him as I can. Keep in mind that this is my second high level programming class (I'm an EE major so I already saw many of the concepts presented in this class in my 150 class)

I'll start off with the bad. Herman can be kind of an asshole at times. He follows his syllabus to the letter, so if he specifies that he  will only answer programming questions in office hours, HE WILL ONLY ANSWER THEM IN OFFICE HOURS. Like even for simple yes or no questions, he will only answer them during office hours which can get really annoying.

His exams are another negative point. For a 100 level programming class, I felt that there were unnecessarily difficult, and this was having already seen most of these concepts in another class already. His exams are often extremely specific, sometimes testing concepts that were only vaguely mentioned during a lecture and are often unnecessary to know for practical programming purposes.

With that being said, Herman is an extremely good teacher. I honestly thought he was a good lecturer, may not have been the most interesting but hey, you try and keep this stuff interesting through 5 different lectures of the same topic. If you want to be successful in this class, go to his lectures as much as possible. I would also recommend using his office hours a lot, not because he will only answer questions during them but also if you ask him a question then you will get a detailed and thorough answer that will almost surely help you. 

Like I said, I have seen most of the programming concepts presented in this class in a previous coding class, however, I still found his projects to be rather straight forward. If this is your first high level programming class I would suggest starting early, but you should not have difficulty completing them on time and getting a good score on the project.

Overall, I would recommend Herman if you really want to learn the topics presented in 132. Yes he is an asshole, but it will be worth putting up with because you will learn a lot."""|4

(1) He lectures off slides that are sketchy and incomplete, speeds through them, often flipping before students who write really quickly can jot down notes, and refuses to post slides in advance so that students can prepare for how he speeds through them and take notes on the slides themselves.

(2) He uses vague ambiguous, conceptual verbiage that doesn't convey the underlying technical specifics so that you can learn the material in a concrete way from his lecture delivery.  

For example, on joining concurrent threads:  """"A thread can wait for another one to terminate by calling join(). public final void join() returns when the thread it's called on quits""""  There is no specific technical information in that passage that tells you what to do or what is happening in the software.  

Here is the kind of specific, technical language that is more helpful, from in the tutorials on docs.oracle.com: """"The join method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing, t.join(); causes the current thread to pause execution until its thread terminates.""""  

Yet, Herman teaches with fuzzy, untechnical language but tests to a much higher level of technical rifor than he lectures with.

(3)  All the students in the class who have language disabilities or communication disorders are completely swamped with trying to make sense out of his terrible lectures off sped-through slides and ambiguous language, and finding alternative instructional materials/spending days in the tutoring lab inorder to compensate sucks time that is frankly unavailable to CS students.

(4)  HIs tests are unreasonable to an absurd degree.  He tests on variable names that are in example code that come as side downloads to his lectures.  His use of variable names in such side code downloads is nonstandard.  The amount of pedantic memorization he requires is excessive."""|1

"""Decent professor in terms of communicating the material. Most of the other reviews cover his unique style like the no electronics policy, taking attendance every lecture, and not letting students sit in the back.

At first I hated his style, but later on I realized that the way he teaches drills the material into your head and forces you to pay attention. If you attend most of his lectures and sit in the front and pay attention, I guarantee you'll get an A. His exams were fairly straightforward, but the only thing I didn't like about them were the extremely specific details to which questions were asked. He would change one little obscure thing to see if you really knew your stuff. Annoying, but manageable.

"""Two semesters ago I took CMSC 132 with Larry Herman. I hated it. Every word that came out of his mouth filled me with aggravation and contempt. I thought he was an egotistical, straight edged jerk not to mention being completely boring and seemingly condescending to students. I was dreading the previous semester knowing that he was the only teacher for CMSC 216.

 As every other reviewer has mentioned he does in fact take attendance, force people to sit in the front, prohibit electronic devices during lecture, etc. He will also ask the trickiest, exception-to-the-rule questions on tests that are generally the difference between an A and a B. 

Some of the projects can also take a pretty good amount of time and probably average to about 20 hours or so but can be done in a lot less time with good planning/understanding. However, if you don’t know what you’re doing, he tends to not include some of the key details on his slides so you will not be able to get a lot of the practical information unless you are regularly attending lecture even though he says that the “lecture notes will be posted on line so you don’t need to take notes” which most students mistakenly interpret as “you don’t need to come to class”. 

Yet as the semester went on I slowly came to the realization that he was actually doing almost all of these things to the benefit of the students. 

As was noted in a reviewer below me noted, the no-electronic policy forces you to pay attention with the exception of an occasional text. 

Preventing students from sitting in the back gets them closer to the material and allows him to police for devices better. 

His stringency on the honesty policy is annoying on face value, but definitely one of the most annoying things are when people who have no understanding of material get credit for things other people came up with, so his strictness could be out of respect for the students that are actually doing their own work. 

His attendance taking is also not in the grading policy, so lack of attendance will not directly affect your grade. He claims to use it simply as a statistical study on the grades earned versus attendance, but I also suspect that he uses it for curving. For example, he will be much more likely to curve up a grade from a B+ to at least and A- if he sees that they have attended almost every lecture. 

Almost any time a good portion of the class is in jeopardy of missing the project deadline, he will extend it even though if the whole class wouldn’t have been remiss in their responsibilities as students and started even a few days earlier they would have been fine. He always assigns them with ample time in the first place. Ample.

Also, early in the semester I discovered that I had a scheduling conflict with the final exam and he said that it wasn’t a problem and let me take it with three other people at a later date. 

I also missed a quiz and hadn’t notified him or the TA until the day of and he still allowed the zero to be replaced with the average of my other quiz grades.

Concerning the lecture material, he is good. He is always well prepared and he always drills the important parts that you need to remember. Always. Drills. Knowing these drilled points should secure you a B in the class. 

To achieve an A in the class, Larry expects a mastery of the subject material. He expects an A to signify Excellence, unlike other classes where A stands for Average and anything below that stands for Stupid.

Therefore, Larry is a great teacher. Anyone who argues otherwise is either too stupid to get the grade they want, or too arrogant to put in the work he requires. In short, if you are smart and willing to work, you will like him and you will do well. Or even if you don’t like him, you will at least respect him, and he will do the same for you. No question about it."""|5

"""The short review is as follows: Larry Herman is good at teaching but terrible at conveying his expectations. You need to understand and memorize EVERYTHING he mentions, even in passing, to excel in the class, and you need to start on programming projects much sooner rather than later because they are deceptive when you first read the description.

In detail:
Mr. Herman is the best lecturer I have had in the past five semesters. In addition to knowing the course material, he is typically capable of conveying it to the class. His M.O. is to lecture using PowerPoint slides, asking the class if they understand before he discusses examples. MOST of these slides are posted on Blackboard a few days later, but they often have questions without answers on them. The examples that he presents in class are always basic illustrations of the topic at hand. He also maintains the class's interest when he talks about the more pedantic aspects of OOP by seamlessly working brief, amusing comments into his lectures.

On the other hand, however, I must remark that the class is heavily geared toward audial instruction. That is, the """"learn by doing"""" aspect of the class is lacking. I was disappointed that there was little middle ground when it came to the difficulty of assignments. While the worksheets in discussion were similar in difficulty to the lecture examples, projects were significantly time-consuming. Part of this may have been because while I personally learn best by reading the book/writing code, the text for the class only discusses data structures, and not other  topics covered in the class (Out of five, only the second and third projects focused predominantly on creating data structures. The first was a review of CMSC131, the fourth was about graph traversal, and the fifth was about multithreading, I/O, and connecting to the Internet).

Furthermore, tests were obnoxious, in the sense that perhaps 20% of each test dealt with trivia. In the case of the final, this took the form of, """"Do you happen to remember this fact about Java that I mentioned offhand halfway through the semester, and that you probably never used when you were completing the projects?"""" The rest of each test was either writing code or tracing a program. The grading is stringent - I recall losing 8% on the second exam because I implemented (correctly) an O(n^2) algorithm instead of an O(n log(n)) algorithm. Basically, in most cases, it does not suffice in this class to get your program to compile and function correctly; you must also write it efficiently and know other ways you could have achieved the same functionality.

All in all, Mr. Herman has been my second-favorite teacher at UMD (after Prof. James Schafer of the Math department), and a few, but not all, of my complaints about the class are not his fault. I was actually signed up for Mr. Emad's section of 132 at the beginning of the semester, but I switched out immediately after sitting in on one of Mr. Herman's lectures. Best decision so far of my college career.

One final note: as you progress through the class, make a condensed version of your notes to serve as a rudimentary study guide for exams. It will be very helpful."""|3

However, he can be dickish and may be hard to approach, but he's far from the """"useless lecher"""" that the other reviews make him out to be. 

Things to remember: 
1) if you go in there expecting to hate the class because he's cocky, monotone, etc, you've pretty much just made a self-fulfilling prophecy.

First off, this was his first year teach this course so he didn't know what he was doing or how to present the material.

His monotone voice will just drag you away from the lecture.

The material itself is interesting, but no where near interesting presented by Herman. He just jumps everywhere and the notes he posts online aren't even what he explains in class or goes into detail about. Then when it comes to exam time, the material there were things he never went through. Btw, don't expect reviews by him for the exams. 

The only thing that will save your grade in this class are the 6 projects in class, just because you can't get them wrong. He doesn't grade anything, its all the TA (who you never meet). 

The only thing that makes you come to class are his clickers, which are irrelevant questions. 

There was one point where everyone complained about his way of teaching and the difficulty of the course because of how he taught, but he laughed it off and didn't address it.

"""I read the reviews below before taking 106 with herman and was very surprised.  I thought he did an excellent job teaching the course.  Granted 106 is supposed to be easy so maybe that is why I thought he did a good job.  
I almost never had to open the textbook because all I had to do was listen to lecture and then I would have everything I needed to do the projects.  He was mildly funny and kept the class engaging.  To be honest if you actually go to class arrive on time and pay attention you should be able to learn from him. 
The projects were nit-picky, but that is because he has a program grade them to ensure accuracy (But I must say most of the projects were pretty easy for me, although many of my classmates struggled).
The tests were a little more difficult just because I find it hard to write code on paper (you have to write a short program for most tests).
Quizzes in discussion were announced and generally just quickly reviewing the previous two lectures would give you enough information to get ~36/40 on the quiz.
Seriously if Herman is the worst lecturer in the CS department then the department must have the best lecturers on campus because he really wasn't that bad.
P.S. go to class and pay attention it really helps even if you don't think it does.

I also took CMSC131 with Herman:
Same as above pretty much, a lot of people just have no logic and do not belong in computer programming classes (or the major).  Logic cannot be taught, and if you don't have any then go away, you are annoying to the rest of us that can actually figure things out.  Seriously, he does a good job, if you don't excel in his class it's not his fault, you just aren't capable of the programming logic approaches, which is okay, just change majors.

For CMSC131 Do not buy the textbook, I always buy my textbooks, but the Java book is a waste of money, EVERYTHING IS ONLINE:

"""Lectures:
In most of his classes, he starts out by talking about something in his life (or ends up talking about it), which is fine - if I weren't paying for classes! It takes up time, and sometimes he doesn't go over as much as he wanted. He absolutely hates if someone's using a laptop or phone in class, which is understandable...but he sounds like a douchebag when he asks someone to put it away. He usually goes over his slides by reading them, and not really adding to them. If he does add to them, write it down, cause his quizzes and tests are nitpicky. He rarely writes on the board, and if he does, make sure you're in the front, cause he writes small ! 

Quizzes:
I don't think he writes his own quizzes. The set up of the worksheets usually have nothing to do with the quizzes. Don't focus on what the worksheets are on, cause most likely, it's not gonna be on the quiz. There were only 2 times where the class knew what the quizzes were on. He doesn't even really give the TAs a heads up on anything, so the TAs are clueless until the day of the quizzes. Also, most of the time, the average on the quizzes are around 20-25 points out of 40, so don't give up...

Homework & Projects:
Don't ever ever turn anything in the night it's due. If the server goes down, he may or may not give an extension. Try to get all the points on the Homework, cause that will help your grade. Even though you only need to get HALF of your tests working on the projects, try to get 60-70%, cause his TAs might rule out some of the public tests that you *thought* you passed. Plus, going above the minimum means you'll probably be above the curve. Try to get some secret tests done, too....cause some people don't do those, and that's about 30 points.

TA:
Try not to get Gleneesha, cause she'll just point on the board at code and expect you to understand what it does. She doesn't really explain anything, and if she does, it's not thorough. It makes me think she doesn't know anything. Granted, I heard all TAs sucked, especially for CS, but it'd be nice to have someone who DIDN'T have to Google some answers in front of you...

Books:
Don't bother buying them. I bought them halfway through the semester thinking they'll help, but I have yet to actually use them. Half the class didn't buy any, and they're doing fine. He also asked the class (of those who bought them) if they were useful, and everyone said no. Don't bother."""|1

He always emphasized that the Honors class did way better than us, but the fact is that they did better because he was not teaching the Honors section. Quizzes averaged around the 50-60% in our class, and it was solely because he does not explain concepts well. If you have no choice but to take the class with him, expect a lot of self-teaching and expect a lot of stress. He assigns projects that are always half-assed and is always revising them up to the last second.

He says """"Umm...um...um..."""" a lot, and he makes awkward comments to girls. Overall, he is a very awkward person and he seems to be the only uninteresting Comp. Sci. professor. Quizzes are easy if you learn everything by yourself. Exams are graded in a strict manner so it is really hard to get a decent grade on the exams (1 midterm, and the final).

Besides wasting time trying to figure out how the projection boards work, he goes off in tangents. Most of the class stopped attending his lectures, so he started taking attendance. So people went to the lectures just to sign the attendance sheet.

He will call you out if you have your laptop out, if you are sitting in the very back, if you come to class late, or if you leave early. He is extremely annoying and rarely sympathizes with you (except if you are a girl)."""|1

His lectures are generally well done and he knows what he is talking about. He has some weird habits though. Whenever something goes wrong he will always make up like 100 excuses as to why it's not his fault. He's kind of pompous, but class was pretty enjoyable.

The quizzes were pretty easy imo, but the class averages were always terrible (25-30). Look over the past couple lecture slides before the quiz!!! The midterm and final were both very fair.

Homework & Projects: Do NOT wait until the night before it's due to start. Seriously, don't. The projects and homework are all doable, but they will take serious effort on your part. You will get stuck, you will have to redesign code, you will have to use the debugger, and you will have to read all the specifications beforehand. That being said, it is possible to do well on all the projects. I got 100% on all the public tests for projects. I can't comment on how the office hours works, I never had to go to them.

TA: Gleneesha was a pretty terrible TA imo. I went to most of the discussion sections, but I only learned a couple things from them. The worksheets that they give you in discussion are useless, I would just use the time to study notes and work on projects. 

Books: Overpriced and not needed. The internet is the only resource you need.

The beginning of this course proved to be very easy because before the midterm exam (end of october) all we had were 2 quizzes, 1 homework, and 1 project. Note that the grading system is sooooooo stupid that if you make a mistake that doesnt even make an impact on your work, you WILL lose alot of points. So be careful and read the directions because even if you show that you understand the problem and explain it very well, you will lose full credit if you dont follow the exact directions. That is what happened to me, i lost 2 letter grades on a quiz on something that stupid even though i clearly understood the problem. 

After the midterm he just threw everything at us at once, all the hws, projs, and quizzes giving us barely anytime, he had to give a hw and a prog at the same time over thanksgiving because he had to fit it all before the semester is over! I had no problem with this because i knew the material already but for those who dont know the material, your pretty much screwed. Also office hrs are always packed so go early if you need help.

I took ap programming in high school and i understood every single topic in the class but yet i still couldnt get an A+. The reason is because of the grading again. It is just terrible and he is very slow at getting your work back. It is december 17 and only 40% of our grades have been posted. We still havent gotten back our proj 2,3,4 and hw 2,3 back yet which is the majority of our grade. Plus the TAs do not know what they are doing. Most of the time i think im smarter than them. If you want an A or even a B you must know the topic before you take the class, or else you are pretty much screwed.

I had to go into office hours many times to correct some stuff they weren't clear on. One of the secret test was written wrong for project one and i had to argue it too and i still dont know if he changed it because he hasnt updated the grades yet.
All programmers know that when comparing objects you either return a negative or postive number or zero. On the stupid secret test they wrote it so that it checked to see if you did -1,1 and 0. That is wrong and i had to tell Mr. Herman. Plus the submit server doesn't work all the time so turn in your projects early.

The problem with not getting our many projs and hws back is the fact that we cant go in to see Mr. Herman to see what we did wrong cuz the semester is over!! so if i find out that they graded something wrong (which is very likely) contacting and arguing will prove to be so much pain.

So over all this class will be easy yet stressful for those who know the subject and a horrible nightmare for those who dont know it well. So good luck to those taking this class!! You're going to need it haha"""|3

He isn't a terrible person, not at all, but I also wish he would answer simple questions (such as small questions about the syllabus) via email.

His course web site is not very helpful. The syllabus is on there with the exam dates, but if he changes them you won't know unless you go to class.  And he probably will change them. He won't announce it on the page. He won't send an email about it. So if you skip a few classes you can end up missing an exam. I suppose it's somewhat clever to passively force students to go to class, but what boggles my mind is that he does update the front page with info that has nothing to do with the class like """"Techfest in CSI lobby.""""  

His lecture slides are useless. Which brings me to another point about the web page - You need a password to get in. You need a password to look at his useless slides. When the semester is over, the password stops working so you can't look at projects or anything from the previous semester as a reference. He puts a half-useless web page on lock down for no good reason. 

His tests and quizzes are essentially designed to make you lose points. They are filled with multiple choice or short answer trick questions that you pretty much have to memorize the answers to. You are NOT going to remember everything. It's impossible unless you dedicate your entire life to every word that comes out of his mouth and every trick question that could possibly be on the test.

The projects are rough and time consuming, which is understandable. But this guy makes it worse. He sometimes doesn't post a project on the submit server or the public tests until a couple of days before it's due. He also changes the due dates and details, or corrects mistakes about the project almost at the last minute. I have a feeling he is probably procrastinating and making it all up as he goes along. Teachers for other programming classes don't seem to do this. This is the only programming teacher I've had so far who constantly has this problem.  

He takes too long to grade stuff. He leaves the responsibility of grading everything on the TAs, and they take forever to grade the project style worth 15% of the project grade. I don't blame them. They are students. They have their own classes to worry about too. This guy could at least grade some of them to speed things up. He curves everything at the end, but he takes forever to post stuff on the grade server. You wont have any idea what your true grade is. He doesn't post the class average. If what you currently see as your grade doesn't look good, you won't be able to know whether you are failing or not until the semester is over and there's nothing more you can do about it.

So all in all, it's like he wants to make sure that everyone is as stressed out and in the dark as possible. And whatever research or non-teaching activities this guy is involved in is obviously far higher on his priority list than this class. Quite frankly, this is not a good learning environment."""|1

"""Herman is an ok lecturer. As someone as said below, the material itself is very boring as you are just learning the C language, because a language is just a language, there's not really any way to make it exciting. 

Herman is also pretty fair in terms of the curve at the end of the semester. I had a low B according to my grades, but he ended up giving me an A. So it is definitely possible to do well in his course even if it seems like you are doing pretty bad, which it will.

So you're probably wondering why I gave him 2 stars because so far my review has been ok. The reason is that he is probably the rudest teacher I have had so far in my time at CP. If you try to contact him in any way he will most likely come up with some terse, scathing reply that basically says """"I hate you for contacting me. Just go away, you're wasting my time"""". I have heard so many stories from my friends of emails they have received from him that were completely out of line or times when they've gone to office hours and he blew them off or didn't help them at all. 

Also, Herman will try to make you fail at every possible chance. His quizzes and tests often have very specific questions designed to make people get the wrong answer. His project specs are almost always at least 8 pages long, all in paragraph format, just to make sure you miss some details that he can catch you on in the secret tests. For style grading, he tells the TA's that they can only take points off in increments of 2. So if you made some small mistake it's automatically at least 2 points off, not 1.

The bottom line:
Pros: In the end, your grade in Herman's class will probably be better than you expected since he curves a lot. Also, you will learn a lot of practical knowledge about makefiles and low level programming that will be useful in internships and you will become pretty good at C programming.

Cons: You will be miserable throughout the entire semester  because you will be working on 212 projects all the time, and you will get at most a C on all the quizzes, and you probably won't do as well on the tests as you do in other classes. And Herman will be there all the time, acting immature and being as rude and sneaky as possible."""|2

"""Having taken the same class with him twice, I think some of the reviews here are probably out of sheer bitterness. Despite failing once and retaking the course, I really don't have any angst for the guy. The sexist remarks from other reviewers are unfounded. I'd say there's more difficulty in the material and lack of enthusiasm one can have for the material, but I wouldn't fault Larry for that.

In all honesty, I think Larry was an okay lecturer. 212's material itself is pretty dry and bland (or at least low-level programming isn't that interesting to me). He really doesn't read completely off the slides, I think. I went to all of his lectures this semester vs. the previous semester and there definitely was a lot of stuff he mentioned verbally that shows up on quizzes and exams. This semester he had a no laptop in class policy which I do applaud him on. He really wants you to focus on the lectures which I'd say are pretty key to passing. Just reading the slides without going to class isn't going to work well. Oh, and be sure to actually read the textbook (unlike 131/132). It's quite helpful.

The projects were pretty tough to get into. They aren't exactly interesting either. Gone are the days of the 131/132 pretty interfaces. He's very specific in his specs, and they turn out to be VERY long reads (pages of information). I find working backwards from the public tests he gives you and re-reading the sections specific to each individual functions help. And of course there's office hours which is unfortunately usually busier as the deadlines for the projects approach. The projects do consume quite a bit of time, so start early.

Exams aren't too bad. He definitely asks random questions about things he might have barely touched on in class. These questions aren't worth a lot, but it is still annoying to lose those small points. This semester, he seemed to test less topics than we actually went over, which wasn't exactly a bad thing. I just wish some of the other things we learned had more purpose than just learning it for the sake of learning it. Some stuff didn't even show up in projects, for example. However, during lecture he does ask the class these random questions once in a while that nobody answers which often show up on quizzes or exams, so be alert for that.

He prefers seeing you in person to ask even the simplest questions. Often you can ask him a question in lecture or via e-mail that could be answered in a sentence, but he says to come to office hours anyway. I've also heard of people who were told to come back later when they come to office hours, so he sometimes is hard to reach (allegedly, haven't witnessed it myself).

The curve at the end of the semester is pretty generous though. Even getting a low 60's could possibly turn out to be a C. Of course the curve varies each semester, so your mileage may very.

In all fairness, yes he's a bit rough around the edges and the material isn't exciting, but he and the class are basically the gatekeepers of you reaching the 300-level courses so learn to deal."""|3

"""1. Larry Herman teaches at a snail's pace. And by that, I mean an elderly snail that has trouble being mobile. This class is a non-majors CS course, so it goes slower than most CS classes. But the pace at which Larry Herman explains things is simply intolerable, even for someone who has never encountered computer programming. Yet Herman does not even teach effectively. He follows the book closely but does not present the material in an effective manner. He writes long explanatory sentences on the board but does not actually describe what they mean.

2. He loves to make the class more irritating than necessary. He doesn't care about his students at all. I found discussion useless since I program in C and Java at my job but didn't feel prepared enough to test out of 131. However since unannounced quizzes were given in discussion, so I had to go. Yet Herman forbade the TA from telling ANYONE when the quizzes were. So each student was forced to either (a) go to every single discussion where the TA (who was horrendous, by the way) mumbled insensibly for an hour or (b) try to guess when the quizzes were and attend discussion on those days. Personally, I thought professors and TAs were supposed to make learning easier, NOT harder. 

3. Tests and quizzes are fair and well written. 

4. Projects are fair, but he has an annoying way of saying important things during lecture. For example, due date changes announced the day before Thanksgiving break. Too bad I had a plane to catch. And he never, EVER e-mails out these important little details. He WANTS you to come to class for some obscure reason (aka feed his pride), since his lectures are useless and boring. Clearly he cares more about you coming to his lecture than about you succeeding. 

5. Projects and quizzes are not returned in a timely manner. Herman doesn't seem to realize that his TA is the worst grader possible, and when told so, he takes no action on it. 

6. Class website is easy to use and well-organized. The textbook is useful.

He never changed the due date anywhere, because he only wants people who come to class to know. So in desperation to finally know when it is due, a student emails him asking to confirm the due date, (a simple administrative question), he responds, """"We discussed this in lecture. Don't email me.""""  Well, how about you just answer the question? 

2. Deducting points from your final grade for not picking up graded materials. Honestly, who cares? This is just another power trip for him.

3. The overall requirements. I have lost 10 points for minor errors in style(1 character past the 80 limit), and different versions of the compiler from the submit server can seriously mess your grade up, but that's something you can't really control.

He's a knowledgeable guy as a CS teacher, but he never let students ask questions, and his lectures were so boring.

"""• Having a good grade in a class doesn’t mean an instructor was good 
• Being able to manage a trash prof- oh I meant lecturer, doesn’t suddenly make them good 

Just had to put that out there towards the students who, in their reviews and group me’s, like to downplay just how shitty this instructor is. 

For one, he restricts the kind of material that you can use when completing projects, so that the only way to know the acceptable concepts you can use, is to watch is lectures, where he frequently cuts students with questions and says “come to my office hours” to pertinent questions.

Managed to find alternative, clever ways to arrive at an answer during your projects? How cute, can’t use it, wasn’t covered in class.

Imagine i asked you to compute the roots of a polynomials; anyone who’s taken precalc knows that there are *several* ways to do this, and everyone has a preference for which method to use. Imagine i told you: oh, you only have to do it one particular way, and it turned out to be the way that hasn’t clicked for you. Well tough luck

This is only beneficial to students who have little programming experience, because, otherwise, you start filtering out *lots of concepts* you’d naturally internalized over your years of programming.

Never in my life have I seen such idiotic modus operandi for a course, not even Intro to DS which is a super difficult course. His excuse? I dOnT wAnT sTudEnts to make mistakes that are hard to debug , as if students don’t already struggle with the concepts taught HIS way!

This means that you can’t rely on learning from SO or YouTube, unless you can *ensure* that their methods of teaching, illustrating a concept or constructing an algorithm are pedantically similar to his ways.

Tell me again how such a “lecturer” manages to earn the “hE’s hOneSTLy gOoD” review. Again having a good grade in the class doesn’t make the instructor a good one. 

The icing? You blow this fuss over projects that will end up having so little weight towards your overall grade. Can’t even skip some of them though, because GFA will give you to complete them. His excuse? We want you to make sure to understand the concepts as following topics will rely on them. Guess what? It’s possible to understand concepts and do poorly on projects, especially given the insanely long descriptions (that magnify the likelihood of
Missing crucial details) and the self indulgently silly requirements. But who cares? Do as Larry says

Now the tests: ah, ain’t it beautiful that the last question of every test is not only the longest, but also weight 1/4 of the overall test’s grade? Not only are the projects insanely painstaking (with *little* reward), but the exams are set up for you to fail.

And he has the audacity to pretend to be shocked at the consistently low averages in the class

The kicker? With all this perfectionism of his, he has no qualms about cancelling lectures/discussions to “go to a doctor appointment”, no qualms about making mistakes in project descriptions, no qualms about missing certain topics in lectures. Basically a “do as I say, not as I do” kind of person

2. He's easy to talk to in office hours if you don't mind his sarcasm and bluntness. I didn't mind it, but I know some people might.
3. Curves pretty generously.
4. The Good Faith Attempt for every project was to just pass half the public tests, which I liked much more than how it was in 131/132.
5. He has a lot of memorable quotes lol

Cons:
1. Grading takes way too long. Project and exam grades easily take over a month.
2. Exams were insane. He gives several multiple choice where you need to pick all the answers that apply. If you pick a wrong answer you lose points for that question. He also gives a debugging problem that's worth 20-25% of the exam grade, and if you can't find the bug or change it correctly then say goodbye to a good amount of points.
3. For some reason, the release date for a new project always seemed to be a day or 2 before another exam, so you're stuck studying but you also have to worry about a new project. Unless you procrastinated, I would STRONGLY advise putting off studying and trying to finish whatever new project is released before an exam. His debugging questions are usually related to whatever new topic the project covers.

Overall I don't think he's a bad professor, but I can definitely see why a lot of people don't like the way he teaches."""|3

He however, does not understand his students very well and if their are other options for professors, i'd gravitate towards them, however, if you get herman it really isnt the end of the world and I am sure you will make it out fine."|2

This man is the worst professor that you could ever have. People who review 4 or 5 star must be on something or just naturally gifted at cs.


Class setup: You only got to go to lecture once every 2 weeks. I even got lecture zoom links for times when I was in other classes, so I couldn’t go. The rest was watch the lecture videos which are posted roughly 8-16 hrs later. Worst experience ever, literally COULDN’T go to live lecture for a whole month. Had to schedule other classes around finding time to watch lecture videos whenever they got posted out of the blue, screwing up any relative organization of my classes. He often cuts of students asking questions and just says come to my office hours. No Piazza, cannot email him and regular office hours with TAs are a mess. Also have fun seeing your exam and project grades a month after completing them. Very hard to guess where you grade is at for 80% of the semester. 

Projects: First off, only public and secret. Can only submit up to I think it was 6 times before you were penalized. Have to run tests using Grace. Oh that’s another thing, the super ancient system and the way that everything is taught using emacs. Just use vscode. There should be a document floating around about how to set it up. Content wise they are fair ngl. The project descriptions are about 10 pages long so I’d say 95% of common errors and edge cases are explained. If you follow the documentation and code to covers those cases  the projects will still be hard but you will be fine passing the public tests and probably some of the secret tests. DO NOT procrastinate on them. They are weighted incredibly low so they do jacksht for you grade. 

Exams: These are basically the do or die of this class. I think majority of averages were around 68%, with one at 56%. The way you have to answer the multiple choice which pretty much usually has more than one answer is super stupid. Let’s say there are two answers out of 5. Suppose that A & B are correct but you put down A & C and, so the points gained and lost for that question equal out to zero, so it is like you never attempted the question. You have to be super confident to get points on these because any incorrect answers will lower your grade. Don’t even try to guess on these questions because you will just hurt your grade. If that wasn’t enough there is a question at the end which takes the longest, but also in a sense is a simple you get it or you don’t. It is worth 25% of the test grade and around 3-5% of you course grade so prey that you know the answer or your grade will hurt just from that.

Please avoid taking him at any cost. Then again, have heard that he is better in person."""|1

"""Let me begin this review by saying that Herman's teaching style is a bit of an acquired taste. If you don't think you can acquire the """"taste,"""" then you will likely not agree with the rest of this review.

Herman's exams were generally fair, you just have to read (a fact that my expected A- shows that I can't always do).

"""I think Mr. Herman is a very good instructor (though he makes it very clear that he is NOT a professor; he once gave us a mini quiz at the beginning of a lecture about this)! 

Now, I should mention that I did have some programming background prior to the course, so I cannot say for sure what your learning experience will be like if you are new to programming besides taking CMSC131. However, I really enjoyed his teaching style. He gives plenty of examples of concepts, and he puts a significant amount of effort into making comprehensive practice exams and homework assignments so that you are well prepared for the midterms. You can also download his slides and (some) code examples after class to further examine them. 

He does not allow electronic devices in class, and if he catches you using one, he will not hesitate to call you out. I thought that was annoying at first, but his philosophy is that you should be actively listening to his commentary rather than writing everything down on the slides. In fact, when he sees people writing slide material in their notebooks, he won't stop them but he will interject with something like """"you don't have to write this stuff down because the slides will be on ELMS later."""" I think that his philosophy worked well for me, but your mileage may vary of course. He is also very knowledgeable about Java and the Object-Oriented paradigm and will write notes to himself to correct unclear information in his slides or to investigate the answer to a question he was asked.

The homework comes in the form of coding projects. His project descriptions are very well defined (albeit lengthy) and help reinforce the material covered in lectures. However, they are graded pretty slowly (the last four projects have not been graded yet as I write this review), but maybe that will change in the future. 

He also makes a good attempt to engage with his students. He frequently asks questions throughout the lecture to his students and corrects them if necessary. As a bonus, I think he genuinely wants to entertain us and be friendly. For one, he always suggested saying your name when you answered a question. During the last half of the semester, he raffled chocolate and other candy using a specialized program he made. And lastly, you can count on him to try to crack a few jokes every lecture (and even in his assignments too). Yes, they are definitely """"dad jokes,""""  but nonetheless they still made me chuckle and I appreciated it.

Oh yeah and the sheep thing. He likes sheep. But apparently his favorite animal changes from semester to semester, so look forward to that I guess."""|5

"""(Obligatory disclaimer: I took this course with Larry Herman in Spring 2021 when it was taught fully online. However, I currently tutor students in CMSC216 and from what they tell me, nothing is different now with in-person instruction.)

As someone who studies pedagogy and is looking to be a professor, I can confidently say that Larry Herman does not know how to teach, especially in computer science. The fact that he will not allow any electronics (even for note-taking) during lectures on computer programming should tell you enough about what kind of instructor Herman is.

Exams are simply excruciating. While other instructors are moving to exam formats that function more like open-note timed projects (a more realistic scenario in software development), Herman insists on the practice of writing and debugging computer software using a pencil and paper... Additionally, exams often involve questions needing a specific process not covered in the course, and the multiple choice questions are outrageously formatted and graded. During online instruction, Herman insisted on Zoom proctored exams that required invasive lockdown browsers (I love taking exams with a TA staring directly at my face 24/7. Really calms me down).

Projects are mostly fair in terms of what they cover, but the administration over them is needlessly awful. Firstly, project descriptions are convoluted and unnecessarily long. This may help to uncover some edge-cases, but it takes about a day just to digest everything. Secondly and most importantly, you will be penalized if you submit too often before the deadline. No more convenient project backups or even just seeing if you're passing all public tests.

Course structure and lectures are not the worst, but Herman is weirdly against answering questions during lecture and fully embracing things like ELMS and Piazza so there's that.

Overall, Herman makes this course much harder than it needs to be and for absolutely no payoff whatsoever.
I will say that he is understanding if you need an extension and have a valid reason, and he does at least seem to like what he covers. However, this does not change the fact that you should avoid him if you like having a good GPA."""|2

Overall, Herman makes this course much harder than it needs to be and for absolutely no payoff whatsoever.
I will say that he is understanding if you need an extension and have a valid reason, and he does at least seem to like what he covers. However, this does not change the fact that you should avoid him if you like having a good GPA."|2

"""I took both 132 and 216 with Larry and he is an amazing lecturer who keeps his class engaged with jokes and fun activities. You do have to be there for every lecture/discussion because you never know when he's going to have a graded in-class worksheet but he doesn't really care if you're not paying attention as long as you don't use any electronics in class. 

He's also super considerate about assignments and deadlines - he gave extensions on almost all the projects and if you talked to him, then he pretty much gives you as much time as you need to finish the project. His worksheets/slides/homeworks/practice questions are a godsend when you're reviewing for an exam and his project descriptions are super useful when you're trying to come up with edge cases for secret tests (because he literally writes them out for you). 

One last thing - no release tests! You pass all the public tests, write some student tests if you want, and submit your project. Sometimes, if you submit 48 hours early and only use one submission to pass all the public tests, he gives you extra credit (up to 10 points depending on the project).

His class isn't exactly easy but as long as you put the work in, you should do well. Expect to spend 4-6 hours a week in his class if you want to do well."""|5

His exams are very fair if you’ve covered the practice exams and the homeworks. 
The projects are usually not too difficult if you start early and reference the example code; the project descriptions are usually very long but I think they do a good job providing all the necessary information so I never felt like anything was too ambiguous.
He uses worksheets in lectures and discussions to keep track of attendance but they’re largely graded on completion so that’s like free points to me.

"""If you asked me last semester what I would give Larry Herman, I would have said a 2. He essentially makes attending lectures mandatory because of the unannounced classwork. He is a stickler for the rules, like having KN95 mask instead of the generic blue mask (last semester when it was mandatory). He puts a password for all his attachments which is really inconvenient. His projects are probably the hardest among any other classes I have taken and the deadline is not generous (compared to other classes at least). His lectures are extremmmelllllyyyy boring. He essentially didn't curve at all last semester for like the first time because of """"over-performance."""" He doesn't like being called a professor because of the technicalities of the word (lol). I could go on and on about him.

But when you take the other CS classes, you'll start to appreciate him. The biggest issue I have with the current CS classes I take is the inconsistencies in practice content and real exam content. The cheating that goes around doesn't make things any better. In this respect, Larry Herman is tough but fair. Occasionally, yes, you'll get a question that you would not know if you strictly did the practice exam, however, this was rare and often would not take you down too much in points. Also, the amount of time he gives for his exams is more than enough. For the final, it seemed like more than half of the people finished early and left.

Also, Larry rarely makes grading mistakes, at least not to the degree other professors do. For the current classes, I am taking, to put into perspective, I have to make a regrade request almost every single time. I only had to fix a mistake with him once. 

Admittedly, as one of the reviewers here pointed out, I have learned programming outside of the class. And if I didn't have prior experience, I probably would not be as successful in this class, or at the least, I would have had to put more effort to achieve the same result. But honestly, if you genuinely have a passion for coding, that is the only way you can possibly succeed in this major for the average person. And if you have a genuine passion for something, you should have prior experience. And even if you are just here pursuing a CS major for the bank, you gotta admit, there is no CS lecturer fairer than Larry Herman. 

Of course, because I mentioned his flaws with him at the beginning, I had to take a star away. I wish he was a bit more lenient in many respects than I listed above; trust me, I'm not happy that he did not curve grades at all when I took 132 with him. But when you advanced further into the CS major, you'll soon come to realize what a privilege it was to learn from a fair person and the things you complained about are minor inconveniences that even have some sense to it (for instance, he wants people to come to class so learning is more effective, hence unannounced classwork). As one person mentioned in my GroupMe recently, """"You don't know what you had until it is gone."""" Don't take Larry Herman for granted."""|4

"""Soooooooooooooo Maryland law requires me to inform you that Larry Herman is actually a pretty decent not-professor.

In all seriousness, he has his personality quirks, but I haven't found any faults in his teaching style or in his knowledge of the course material. The lecture slides cover pretty much everything you need to know and they include very helpful examples for Eclipse. Lectures are recorded and put on canvas.

Projects are reasonable, his instructions are pretty long but they cover pretty much every edge case you need to consider. They are due roughly every week and a half or two weeks. I usually dedicated around 10 hours for each project, but of course this depends on its length. And he gives extra credit on a few of them if you just turn it in early.

I disagree with the bottom review. I didn't do programming at all outside of class and I did fine. Of course, you should remember material from CMSC131/AP Comp Sci A/whatever, but he gives a pretty detailed review sheet and dedicates a few lectures at the beginning for this.

He doesn't allow electronics in class, going so far as to point people out from across the room who he thinks are on their phone, which a lot of people don't like. He also doesn't really like it when people take notes word-for-word off the lecture slides (this is not a good way to take notes, anyway). And his lectures can put people to sleep, but at least he's funny. If you can get past these things, though, and work diligently on the projects and studying for exams, you will do well.

As long as you attend lectures/watch the recordings, the labs are extremely fair and doable (takes 4-10 hours). He also offers 3-10 extra credit points on some labs for turning it in early. His exams are extremely easy compared to other classes and the upper quartile has consistently scored over 90. He is an amazing teacher and I would really recommend taking this course with him.

He is very organized, good at explaining concepts, and gives us plenty of resources to help understand the material. His labs may seem intimidating at first because of the lengthy project guidelines, but you'll realize that it's better to have more information about the lab than less; you'll never be confused about what you have to do. As long as you attend lectures/watch the recordings, the labs are extremely fair and doable (takes 4-10 hours). He also offers 3-10 extra credit points on some labs for turning it in early. His exams are extremely easy compared to other classes and the upper quartile has consistently scored over 90. He is an amazing teacher and I would really recommend taking this course with him. The only complaint I would have is that projects take a long time to be graded, but that is probably just because of the size of the class.|5

"""Larry is an amazing instructor and a great lecturer. All of his slides are clear with plenty of examples and are provided to you very soon after each lecture along with a recording. The topics in 132 can be confusing the first time you hear them but Larry always did an excellent job of using examples to explain them. Additionally, in every discussion section there are worksheets that are essentially graded on completion, but are SO helpful. The problems on the worksheet really help you understand the lecture material and are representative of the exam questions. When the exam comes around these worksheets alone are usually enough to help you get practice but Larry also provides a 20 page practice set with exam questions. AND on top of that there are optional homework to do to get even more practice. All of these materials have solutions that are thoroughly explained. The projects in this class were challenging but doable and the project descriptions are more than clear. There was also always enough time to complete them, and the TAs were very helpful. The class is organized and Larry keeps everyone updated regularly with his news feed. He couldn't be more clear about instructions and what's going on in class. I can't say enough great things about Larry's teaching style, if you have the opportunity you HAVE to take Larry.

His slides, practice exams, projects, and other resources are really clear and helpful. His grading is also quite lenient. It's quite an easy A if I'm being honest.

However, that's where his positives end. His TAs are horrible in my experience. I'm not sure if he selected them, but if he did, he focused more on choosing TAs that would obey him rather than those who will teach well.

His lectures are extremely boring. They do not help at all. He repeats everything thrice and talks incredibly slowly. He then complains about the CS department putting too much content in the course. This would've all been excused, but he gives worksheets that are graded for completion randomly in lectures, effectively making attendance mandatory.

However, that's all irrelevant compared to his social etiquette. I'd strongly recommend avoiding office hours.

"""Mr. Herman is a really awesome professor all things considered. I was admittedly a bit hesitant to take CMSC 132 with him due to all the bad reviews on here, but I was so pleased with the way the class was taught that I gladly signed up with him again for CMSC 216.

Pros:
- Hard, but fair. The test averages are Bs and Cs, but the tests are very fair. As long as you pay attention in class and take detailed notes, then you will be fine for the tests. For every test, I would review the lecture slides, my notes, the quizzes, past exams, and homeworks online. If you do this, you will get an A in the class. While the questions on the exams are tricky, you will be fine as long as you pay close attention. There are no surprises on the exams.
- He wants you to do well. Even though he is hard to reach and can be terse at times, he really does want the class to do well. He gives tons of practice work through ungraded homeworks, graded projects, and huge practice exams before the real exam.
- Extremely well structured. All the assignments for the entire semester are laid out very clearly on ELMS. All the projects and exams are very clear on what he wants you to answer.

Cons:
- Difficult to reach. He does not supply his email to the class. The only way to see him is after class or in office hours (with a mask on), which he will sometimes cancel unexpectedly. 
- Dry lectures. His lectures can seem very boring and dry, but they are very informative. He often repeats himself multiple times (this is when you know it will be a question on an exam)

"Mr. Herman is a really awesome professor all things considered. I was admittedly a bit hesitant to take CMSC 132 with him due to all the bad reviews on here, but I was so pleased with the way the class was taught that I gladly signed up with him again for CMSC 216.

Pros:
- Hard, but fair. The test averages are Bs and Cs, but the tests are very fair. As long as you pay attention in class and take detailed notes, then you will be fine for the tests. For every test, I would review the lecture slides, my notes, the quizzes, past exams, and homeworks online. If you do this, you will get an A in the class. While the questions on the exams are tricky, you will be fine as long as you pay close attention. There are no surprises on the exams.
- He wants you to do well. Even though he is hard to reach and can be terse at times, he really does want the class to do well. He gives tons of practice work through ungraded homeworks, graded projects, and huge practice exams before the real exam.
- Extremely well structured. All the assignments for the entire semester are laid out very clearly on ELMS. All the projects and exams are very clear on what he wants you to answer.

Cons:
- Difficult to reach. He does not supply his email to the class. The only way to see him is after class or in office hours (with a mask on), which he will sometimes cancel unexpectedly. 
- Dry lectures. His lectures can seem very boring and dry, but they are very informative. He often repeats himself multiple times (this is when you know it will be a question on an exam)
- No electronics. He does not permit phones, computers, or any electronics in class."|5
"""Lectures:
Pros: Incredibly important and dense. If you get these, you should pretty easily pass the class.
Cons: Incredibly boring, and dense. A genuine struggle to listen to because of how sleepy it can sometimes be. I have ADHD so sometimes I want to just run out of the lecture hall. If you don't pay attention, you are going to hurt your grade significantly (My grade suffered a lot). It's genuinely really difficult to pay attention.

Projects(Huge part of your grade): 
Pros: Each project comes with a file that basically tells you exactly how to do it. If you follow these, you don't need to think a whole lot about what to do. Lots of bonuses if you are diligent.
Cons: Each project comes out right after the other, so it's a neverending grind. There is always barely enough time to get them done, if you slack off you will be tweaking the last few days. The projects are still pretty hard and debugging them is very pinpoint. And the TAs can be hit or miss. 

Exams:
Pros: He gives out practice exam material that is very lengthy.
Cons: Really hard, really specific details you can only get from the lecture or the textbook. Sometimes the grading is insanely harsh. I still haven't really cracked the code on how you are supposed to do well on these(I've basically failed both). The practice material is (as he says) a good metric for how much you actually know. You still need to extensively study after that.

Other things to know:

1. There are a lot of attendance-based worksheets that are 11% of your grade. The TAs are pretty cutthroat with these so make sure you attend and have an excuse or two.
2. The office hour system is awful. Too many people and not enough TAs. When we switched to Quuly, I literally waited 6 hours in line before I got help.
3. Cheating in this class is basically impossible. I would not try and bullshit with someone else's code. Someone accidentally posted their code to GitHub and within 3 minutes
they got emailed by the UMD CS department for cheating because apparently, Larry has a web scraping bot that checks the internet for similarity in code between submissions and the internet on at least an hourly basis. And before you say """"cheating is impossible in any cs class"""" not it isn't. Yoon barely checked his student's code for plagiarism.
4. Larry is a fairly nice and interesting guy. He's just very strict if you don't have a good reason for not doing something."""|3

"""Larry gets a lot of shit, but let's be clear about his strengths and his issues. For starters, it is impossible to be unclear about expectations for this course -- essentially every piece of information about the course, daily updates, practice material, etc. are available from the beginning and updated very frequently. Deadlines for projects are also fair, given that you start early. Basically, if you stay on top of studying from the textbook (Reek is goated), keeping up with material, watching videos online, and doing the projects yourself, you can succeed in this course.

That being said, there is a ridiculous amount of content, so it doesn't take much to fall behind. Larry's lectures and examples, while well-organized, require an immense amount of patience to stay awake in (at least after halfway through the course). He is, without mincing words, super boring. The lecture and discussion worksheets are usually very helpful, but how much you get out of them will often depend on both the quality of your TA and your resourcefulness.

Ultimately, with hard work it's not impossible to succeed in this class."""|4

-Well-structured course with detailed review materials provided by Larry
-Challenging, but fair exams and assignments
-Strong lecturer; can feel boring or repetitive at times but Larry is highly knowledgeable about his subject, and you'll definitely learn new things!

-Larry is hard to approach & talk to (see below), but he will help and support you under proper circumstances.

Cons:
-Larry is a HIGHLY pedantic instructor. His course procedures are distinctly methodical, numbering multiple pages in-length and taking time to understand. Larry also rarely forgives penalties occurred as a result of course misunderstandings.
-The CS department assigns 300-600 students to Larry's classes, which means that individualized help is difficult to come-by with Larry. (Granted, this is an issue which plagues most CS professors anyway)
-Larry bans phones, laptops, and tablets from lecture, although Larry cannot comprehensively enforce this rule.
-There IS mandatory attendance on unspecified days via a graded-worksheet system, and lectures were NOT recorded during this semester. However, worksheets are always graded for-effort (not for-correctness) and I didn't find either of these features to be too disruptive."""|3

My biggest issue with Larry is the way he grades. They take forever to release grades and most of the time all grades aren't released until late May (they were just released today). I had a A+ throughout the entire course, but this was because he had only entered about half of the grades. By the end of the semester he entered some more grades, and my grade dropped to an B+, and now he has entered all grades, I have dropped to a C+.

After all grades were entered except the final exam I had an B+, a score I felt showed my knowledge on the course, but after the final my grade dropped to a C+. I understand that Finals are weighted more and will have a larger affect on your grade, but this is because they are cumulative exams that test your knowledge on all topics that were taught previously and any new topics. Herman doesn't seem to know this and only really only tested us on material he had rushed through for the last couple weeks of class. This exam was much harder than the rest and the average was an D+, and the worst part is that he refuses to bump up grades, even if you are on the edge (89.5, 79.5, etc.).

"""Let me preface this review by saying I think most complaints against Larry or more accurately a complaint against 216 as a class.

Lectures & Discussion:
Larry as an instructor is decent. His lectures are explained thoroughly and he tries to spice them up with some occasional larry humor or interactive demonstrations. (Touching and piping students :3)
His slides however are relatively barebones due to him heavily explaining them with lecture. Since he doesn't record his lectures this means that skipping lectures and going through the slides is NOT a good idea. Thus attending lectures is something you should do, or at the very least get notes from another student. Discussions I felt were pretty useless, but he does have attendance worksheets for both lecture and discussion so make sure that if you skip, you know there's no worksheet.

Projects:
His projects are extremely well-detailed, which is both a pro and a con. He provides a clear understanding of what you need to do and how to do it, but sometimes the project descriptions are so long that you miss one or two instructions in there due to the sheer size. Overall though I think his projects are quite fair and decent to complete. Sometimes there's up to 6% extra credit for the projects too which makes it even better. 

Exams:
His exams are.... hard to quantify in difficulty. Generally, his exams will only test you on concepts clearly discussed in class, so there are no surprises in there. However they are often very specific about small topics sometimes, so if you fail to study for 1 small niche thing you may end up with an abysmal exam grade. For example, you might have a test that only covers ~40% of what you learned in the lecture, so even if you studied the other 60% you might still do bad. Simply put, his exams cover certain things more heavily so you gotta study everything or get lucky. Additionally, extra credit on exams is pretty sparse depending on the question type. This combined makes it tough to get a high grade on the exams generally, but they are fairly decent to earn a """"passing"""" grade. This is made especially better due to the fact that he gives extremely thorough practice tests. The question types are identical usually, but the actual exams just change up the weighting of what's covered on the exams. For example, a practice exam might be 30% about process control, but the exam might only have 10% about that and the rest be about something else. Either way, though the practice exams are VERY helpful and are ESSENTIAL in doing well on exams.

Personality:
This is where people often hate Larry the most. He can come off as rude or abrasive at first because he has some very strict and thorough policies required for you to meet with him, and what you can and cannot discuss. Follow these and you'll get along fine. Don't follow them and you will get thrashed. It is what it is. While definitely annoying, I rarely had to contact him for anything so I never experienced a thrashing. Be warned

Overall tl;dr
Larry is a good instructor with one of the most organized classes I've ever seen. The difficulty comes with tough exams so it may be hard to clinch a high grade, but passing Larry is something that you will be able to do as long as you put in the effort. The class is hard, but very studyable. For reference in my semester, the class avg was ~82% compared to the overall 216 avg of 2.45 GPA. (So a little above avg)

I think Larry is a good pick, esp compared to some of the other profs."""|5

"""In terms of materials, Herman at least has you decently covered, but when it comes to the structure of the class, it feels like a mess. I had him for 132 as well, and the biggest problem that persists through his class is that grading takes absolutely forever to happen, and that you really do not have a good idea of how well you're doing because most project grades take absolutely forever to get published. Most of the grades for this class were released in the last WEEK, and the final exam grade was published TODAY. I do not know why it takes so long for grading to proceed in this class and I never know if I am doing well enough in projects because it always takes so damn long. You'll think you're at a good standing in this class because your percentage has stayed pretty consistent, but then you realize half of the class' grades aren't even published.
At the very least, in terms of material, the lecture slides are okay with what you need to remember, but it can be frustrating to keep up with them because they can be very lackluster in coverage for certain topics, and it can take a hot second to remember what the slides are talking about if your notes weren't the best. They assume that you have gone to lectures and have paid proper attention (which is a fair assumption to make), but they also assume that what they cover clicked immediately with students, and it was especially difficult this semester to go back to slides because for some reason Herman decided to abandon recordings for 216 where in 132 recordings helped a lot with going back to material that I did not fully get. The slides are decent, but not always good enough to go back to review what materials you may want to go back to.
Where Herman's class succeeds, there's way more that frustrated me and it comes from how his class was overall structured, and a lot of issues that he had from 132 in Fall also carried over in Spring. I'd recommend taking Herman anyway though, because out of 216 instructors (at least this last semester) he's overall the best one, but keep in mind that his class may be unreasonably frustrating due to how bad it can be at keeping up with how students do."""|2

"""This is just a list of thoughts, so sorry if its somewhat convoluted.
The topics covered individually are not difficult at all, its just the sheer amount of content there is that may be overwhelming.
Larry teaches the material very well, but he is very boring, enough to make you fall asleep (real).
His project descriptions are long but helpful in covering all the secret tests as long as you read through them (I recommend using the highlighter in Adobe Acrobat).
He has a somewhat built-in curve through worksheets graded for participation, but beyond that he really doesn't curve grades at all.
His exams were both fair and unfair depending on your perspective. On one side everything on the exams were covered and even emphasized during lecture, but on the other side his exams probably cover not even half of the lecture content. However, considering the amount of topics in the course, this seems somewhat reasonable. Also, considering that his exam practice, homeworks, and worksheets cover the supermajority of what will be on the exam (at least this semester), I personally think his exams are mostly fair. If you took 132 with him, you would probably if not already find a pattern with his exams, enough to predict most of the content.
I'd rarely went to office hours, so I don't really have much to say about them except for the fact that he implemented a new system where you have to use a web app to join a queue to get help.
Overall, as long as you put in the effort you will most likely succeed in the class."""|4

"""Unfortunately, he is probably the better option for this class so you have to take him but by no means is he a good teacher. He cares more about the way he does things and following his own philosophies instead of what would be best for the students. One would hope that the policies and the way the class is run would be in favor of putting the students in a position to succeed but that is not the case with this man. It takes months to get grades back (so you cant improve on projects or even know what your grade is) and he doesn't really seem to care about the students. For example, he will blatantly not answer students' questions in lecture for absolutely no reason but at the same time, spend the first 15 minutes of lecture explaining how his teaching style is the best- then he wonders why we are behind on topics. On top of that, his exams don't test your understanding of what is important but small and relatively unimportant trivia about the programming languages. The only positive is that the class is organized and structured but that holds zero value when someone cares as little about their students as he does."""|1

"""Took him for 132 and 216. I liked him a lot because his teaching style meshed with my learning style well, but I see why others would dislike him. I personally think he's great.

Pros: Really planned class - what he says in class and what the TAs say in discussion is what's on the exam. Answers all your questions, and well - if he brushes you off during class, wait until after class or office hours to ask again. I asked him the same question like 4 times after class because I didn't understand, and he was very willing and even said he would change what one of his slides said to stop people being confused in the future. TAs are great too, all the ones I've had experience with were really smart and willing to help. Projects are graded fairly and style is made clear. Project assignments are *exceptionally clear* and I was never confused on what to do past just a little information overload at times. Worksheets are a free 10% of your grade - show up, try, and you're already 1/10th of the way there, and the feedback is quick and TAs will help you understand the answers. Again - main pro for me was that he was really willing to answer questions after class.

Cons: Project grades take ages to come back - really annoying at times. Exam grades are not much better, but they're a little more reasonable. Exam multiple choice is punishing - he really will ask about that one thing he mentioned that one time, then take 6 points off if you don't know it. He expects you to take notes on only what he's saying then go to the slides after class to take notes on those, but that's stupid and bad and doesn't work, and so you will have to give yourself carpal tunnel to keep up in class. He is also really *not* accommodating for absences, even for sickness, which sucks.

Tips: Lectures and discussions are *must attend* - missing one when you have friends who take shitty notes is really hard. The lectures are information-packed and you must know all of it - exams are very likely to ask you about a specific topic that he mentioned that one time. If you have a slow note-taking speed, yikes, he speaks a lot and quickly and it's all informative, interesting, and on exams and projects, and he *will not* let you use a computer/tablet to take notes unless you are very good at hiding it and he does not notice (or you have accommodations). He will tell you to read textbook chapters (optional and required). *Do* read and take notes on the ones he calls required - that, or have a friend who does and lean on them for the worksheets that rely on that info (i was that friend. it was okay but also I really think that's not a very reliable method of learning and my friends rarely seemed to """"get it"""" - I am not a teacher haha). I never read the optional ones and I was fine, but I assume that if you can't keep up notes-wise with everything he's saying in class it would be helpful. The first exam is also always worth way less than the others - I got a C- on my first 132 exam (went to it sick. do not do that.) and still finished the class with an A, although with a lot more effort than I would have usually needed to put in. Worksheets - actually try on these, they really really help you internalize material. Also they are worth a lot of your grade lmfao. When they are graded and collected, write the answers they give on a scrap sheet of paper so that you have them for later."""|4

"""Larry's a pretty polarizing figure, i think he's okay at teaching, but for being a teacher he's defintely not my favorite. 
Pros:
1)  project descriptions. The 10 page project descriptions are intimidating at first, but they're actually a blessing in disguise compared to the terribly vague 132 descriptions. Even then, I still felt like some descriptions were needlessly wordy, but you just had to sift through the filler.
2) Good practice for exams. He gives a huge practice exam as well as optional homeworks that are good for studying. 
Cons:
1) Even though he's pretty good at explaining topics, it doesn't change the fact that his lectures are some of the worst I've ever had to sit through. He has a super monotone voice and the topics themselves are a bore. Combine this with the fact that he bans any form of electronics and you'll have an extremely difficult time staying awake for any more then 2 minutes at a time. Also he seems to be weirdly adverse to answering any questions during class. Oh and he doesn't record lectures and the slides themselves can be very barebones at times. Great.

2) The class itself always feels incredibly behind. He's actually the slowest grader I've ever had in my life which is saying something. What makes it more frustrating is that a nearly half of a project grade can be secret tests + style. How am i supposed to know what to improve on if I literally get my grades at the end of the semester?? Also there's a lot of reading you have to do by yourself. """"Mandatory"""" textbook readings are the most main issue I have especially cuz the textbook itself kinda sucks. There were entire chapters we would have to learn solely from the textbook and then be tested on.

3) Tests are kinda bs. The frq is fine, but the mcq is a joke. It's a bunch of random questions that show up once or twice in a lecture or notes. You'd think guessing would be a viable option, but Larry seems to disagree as you get penalized for choosing the wrong option. You can definitely do good on them, but it just felt like a memorization game more then actually understanding the material.
Overall, I wouldn't recommend him, but he was the lesser of two evils between him and Yoon, who I've heard is somehow worse."""|2

He assigns textbook chapters to read throughout the class in general, but you can get by fine with just going to lecture and reviewing lecture notes and taking your own notes.

HOWEVER, my only gripe with him is that he can be rude sometimes in ways that are a little too much. He'll call you out if he even thinks you are using your phone in class, he has favorites so try to be one of them, he blatantly ignores some students' questions during lecture (b/c of time crunch but still), and during office hours. It's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean in lecture.

His major pros are detailed project descriptions which often give you suggestions on how to start, as well as his practice homework (HW is optional and for your benefit) and exams. Out of any CS professor, his exam questions are the most fair and directly reflect the practice. Even though I set aside 216 for other finals, I found myself breezing through most of the questions, with a tough one here and there. Some of his projects are also very well-made and outshine the stuff we did in 132. However, his cons are just as important to consider. The first isn't really his fault, but it is the amount of material we have to cover in a short amount of time. I feel that he can do a better job managing his time in lectures as we were scrambling to finish everything before the final and before the holiday breaks. Secondly, most of our projects (all the ones with style) were not graded until after the final. This makes it difficult to know if we are practicing good style in our code when we haven't even received feedback from the first projects. Finally, I feel that the multiple-choice questions on exams can be graded a bit harshly at times but that's just my opinion. If you are a student who truly desires to learn the material and excel on exams, I think Herman's a good pick.

2. No proper system of communication as no email for any of the staff, you would have to attend Office Hours to clarify anythingg.

Difficult exams, tricky questions

"""Pros:
- Great Lecturer (I don't personally think his voice is that easy to fall asleep to) and far more organized than Nelson
- Gives a LOT of practice material for exams
- VERY thorough when explaining concepts which I appreciate
- Great project descriptions

Cons:
- His exams are tricky. They will be asking for very specific answers.
- No lecture recordings in case you miss class (this did encourage me to go to class though so it's not all that bad)
- No technology in class (Lowkey this helped me focus so much better but to each their own)
- Lots of graded worksheets (you learn a lot, but there is one very week)

Overall, he is a strict professor, but he definitely knows what he is talking about. If you actually want to LEARN and not get super off track every lecture (*cough* elias and nelson *cough*) Larry is the professor for you. His classes are not easy but you will absolutely learn. I personally enjoy his frankness and monotone voice because he gets straight to the point. Sometimes his jokes make me cringe, but if you can look past that, he's great!"""|4

"""Everyone hating on Larry (at least in 132) have a) never met him and b) majored in CS because they thought it would be an easy 100k out of college. I will say, he is an overly thorough man, but as I have taken his class, I have realized that is probably why he is such a great programmer. Thinking slowly and methodically on exams is crucial because he puts things in there that you will definitely miss if you try to speed through. If you don't try in this class then you won't get an A it is so simple. Also if you have to, pinch yourself to stay awake in lecture because they can actually be really helpful. His practice problems are nearly identical to the actual exams, and for every exam, I just repeat the practice like 5 times. I missed a total of 2 questions over 2 exams using this method.

The projects take some time, but you should be able to finish in around 2 days max unless you get stuck. For the first project I didn't follow the style guide which cost me a letter grade. But, I was able to get the points back because extra credit is offered on almost every project. If you make your student tests well you should be able to pass every test (secret tests included). Coverage is a very useful tool for this and making your code efficient.

Every discussion has a worksheet and it's basically a dice roll if it is graded. This is how he keeps people coming to discussion, but I always show up late and have never gotten points off. I have also skipped a couple times and gotten lucky.

I used to think he was evil too but he's actually so chill. If you are someone who is actually going to study then herman will be a breeze.

Also, don't do anything out of order with him. I think he has OCD so he gets really upset when people a) knock on his door a couple minutes before office hours b) don't get in the quuly. Its kinda weird but still worth because he's actually the goat."""|5

His lectures are pretty boring, however bearable if you really try hard to focus. He tries to make it fun so I don't juge him for this. Like you can see from other comments, he does not provided any lecture recordings. His powerpoints are pretty much useless if you go to his class. And the important tracing details or concepts he often write on the powerpoint, which he doesn't save and inlcude on the uploaded version. So, you have to follow his tracing in class and write them down. 

His projects are extremely diffcult to get 100% on. He is ridiculously strict on styles, like an empty line above each block(start of a if or for loop for example), and comment for each block. You need to add honor pledge, name, section number and otherthings to each project, which is fine, but he doesn't mention in class. He only mentioned to look at style guide, which is a 8 pages pdf. Thus the average on the first project was probably around a 70%...

His exams are fair to be honest. I messed up on the first. Then he made a really easy exam 2. Exam 3 is also fair, probably his regular difficulty, and the average is in the mid 80s. 

He barely provide any coding example, which can be the most useful thing when you study, review or start projects. This is the worst thing I have experienced in his class. I learn from looking at code most of the time, and I believe most students do. Thus be aware of this. There are often coding examples in the textbook, but often doesn't hint you on how to start on the projects. 

I got an A+ in CMSC 131 barely going to class. And I believe getting an A with Larry is definitely doable. It's just going to be much harder, while you are learning the same amount as taking any other lecturers. Or his teaching style is different comparing to what I'm used to."""|2

Midterms were so horrendous he would give you practice exams and then put similar questions on the midterm but solved in a different way to throw you off. The final was actually the most specific questions that no one except people who have never touched grass could solve. The lectures are a waste of time and the slides he post are so vague you might as well not even look. It seems like he made this class as hard as he could just so he can weed out 50% of students.

"""Pretty good instructor. He definitely gets a bad rep from some people due to his style of teaching, but he's a pretty decent lecturer who's generous with extra credit opportunities. He's extremely organized and does a good job explaining concepts and using analogies to help us better understand new concepts. His project descriptions were annoyingly long at first, but I grew to appreciate them because they are EXTREMELY specific; there was very little confusion on what needed to be done. The style requirements and secret tests were also annoying, but they force you to write good comments and thoroughly test your code. What I really appreciated about Larry was that he provides a TON of practice material in the form of worksheets, optional homeworks, and practice exams. His answer keys are also super descriptive as well. 

The only things I disliked about Larry were that he doesn't record lectures, the slides he gives are super bare bones, he basically forces you to go to lecture and discussion, his sleep-inducing monotone voice, and the fact he will stop teaching to tell a person to put their phone away in a room of 300 people at least twice per lecture. 

Overall, I would take Larry over Yoon, but not over someone like Nelson."""|4

"""Best professor I've had at UMD. People like to shit on him but I think it's just because they haven't put in enough work for his class. If you actually study you will do well. You will actually learn in this class if you pay attention. Every lecture was fulfilling because I felt like I was actually learning something. He explains things thoroughly and gives great analogies that break things down so that it's much simpler to understand. I did fall asleep in his class but that's because I'm sleep deprived and I fall asleep in all of my classes.
The """"pop"""" worksheets he gives are literally free points. You get full credit even if you get all the answers wrong or even you don't finish it. You just gotta shop to discussion/lecture. You also get extra credit on projects if you submit 2 days before the deadline and if you only make one submission (it's extremely easy to only make one submission because it's just public tests on the submission server and you already have the public tests in eclipse LOL). His project descriptions are very lengthy and detailed (he's a yapper) BUT very very useful because it's so easy to tell what the edge cases are so you'll be able to pass the secret tests.
His exams are extremely fair. Even though I ate absolute dogshit on the first exam (if I did better I would've gotten an A in the class) I still thought my exam score was fair because I barely studied for it and just overestimated my knowledge. But it made me realize that I should actually try and learn how to study and also it put me into the right mindset for all of my classes and my future classes. For the rest of the exams and the final, I got above 90 because I actually put in the work. By putting in the work I literally just mean studying 1-2 days before. Cramming might not work for everyone but the point is that I'm not telling you to work yourself to the bone, just put in a little more effort. His practice problems are literal crack for the actual exam too.
He also has participation points that are worth 2% of your grade. I'd say participate 3-4 times and you're good. I know this can be difficult if you have social anxiety (as do I), but to be blunt about it, nobody cares about you and they're all focused on their own participation points and trying to answer questions. Honestly, the participation points helped me pay attention in class.
If I were to critique one thing it would be that he grades very very slow. It's the TAs who are grading but I think it is a result of him being kind of disorganized. After we took the final, half of our shit was still ungraded. Literally was shaking in my boots waiting for my projects to be graded. But otherwise, larry is the GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""|4

"""Ok so Herman gets a bad rep, but in reality he is a very good teacher who really cares about your learning.

"""General idea for students taking Herman's class next semester (Using - and + to signal bad and good, = is a net nuetral)
= Rigorous grading rubric on Projects, rigorous enough to where I likely averaged below the average score on each project because I was the type of student to rush projects last minute. This is less so of an issue on Herman's end and more so an issue with me, but I will say that it is possible to do projects the last day before it's late if you know exactly what you are doing. For students taking any class of Herman's, read the style guide to projects before you get hit hard by early projects.
+ Despite the Rigorous grading rubric on Projects, there's extra credit given on projects for only submitting once, and for submitting 2 days early on the projects worth 3.5% of your total grade, which are both 3 points of extra credit.
+ The project descriptions will say exactly what you need to test for on the project, if you follow with the wording of the project, you're likely to pass most, if not all of the secret tests.
= Will not allow students to leave early during an exam. I know this is something a little bit petty to write about but it's something that he does in order to prevent students from leaving and talking about the exam to the next group of students. He also does have a penalty for not including important information, so just remember to write your information correctly on the front and on every odd numbered page.
= Graded worksheets. This idea in general is interesting because this is something that usually occurs in Gen-Ed based classes, but he implements it here in order to encourage students to attend class and discussions. This is a coin-flip based activity as students previously have pointed out, with the spring 2024 semester having 10 graded worksheets out of 28 worksheets we did this semester. 
= No electronics in class, plus no recording of lectures. This is both a good and a bad thing for students. Personally speaking, I likely could of spent time writing my projects during the class time if I was allowed an electronic in class, but he does allow electronics for students with specific accommodations which allow them to have a device out. For those students, it is better to ask him and have Lecturer Herman know who you are so he won't waste time calling you out for something that you're meant to have in the class. He does waste time calling people out on having electronics out, and it's likely wasted up to maybe 1/2 to a whole lecture this semester, but I'd say the intention makes up for the wasted time.
+ Great organization, has structure to the class, may occasionally throw in a joke or stutter, but Herman's only human, this is something that happens to people in general. 
+ TA's are great and are willing to help. Despite not going to any TA's office hours, the TA I had for discussion was great (I had Minsi). The discussion TA's go over the worksheets usually immediately after they are collected if it's graded, or after like half the class if not. The TA's also go over example questions which Herman writes to give students an understanding on questions which likely would have some basis on the exam. Note: Grading TA's grade projects, while the Discussion and Grading TA's grade exams. 
= Expect harder exams which test you on topics which you may not of studied upon. This is why TA's and their discussion help so much!, as the first two exams during Spring 2024 were on the same day as a discussion. Each exam is not a pushover and is structured similarly. There is usually multiple choice, short answer, and a writing prompt. The final had a lot more on this style, but overall, I did above average on exams because of my TA and my general knowledge of the course.

Generally speaking, I barely clenched an A (I had a 92.74%) out this semester as 93% of the class passed the class this semester, so there was no curve in the class as a result. This will change as students in Fall 2024 who enter into college now need a B-, so take that into account. If you want a Lecturer who has generally strict guidelines and will have you reeling to study and do projects early, take Herman. I personally may not have fully enjoyed the class as a result, but the way he does his class should warrant higher rating than the around 3 stars that he does currently."""|5

"""I was about to give him one star but here are my thoughts from the eyes of an international student having decent amount of knowledge with programming beforehand:
- Required Participation: This doesn't make sense at all in my opinion. Yes I understand it's like free 10% of your grade, but like it doesn't make any sense to make it a requirement. Especially when the class size is huge and he doesn't end up looking at the people that he should be picking on. A lecture hall is where the lecturer gets to speak and the students listen, plus it's a cs major.... and discussions exist for a reason....
- Projects: While his projects aren't bad (and yeah no release tests BUT only secret tests, and you basically get the answers in the project document about secret tests if read carefully), the styling requirements is not fun.... Keep in mind, this is an LEP requirement class, so I think those requirements should only go to classes that are computer-science classes (like anything from CMSC216 onwards), because it affects people's grade for no reason.
- Exams: He promised... PROMISED that there won't be any sorting algorithm tracing questions on the final, and drumrolll.... there was indeed an entire page worth of that. I think overall his exams are not hard, and he provides sufficient amount of resources (e.g. ungraded hw assignments, exam practice doc, etc.) to help us prepare well for the exam. Now, one thing that I think is pretty harsh about his exams is the fact that it's very dense. It's very detailed and it can throw you off quite a lot. I suppose this class is great at training you to be a better programmer and coder for future career reasons, but honestly in terms of grade, say bye bye to that. I think of it like a trade-off.
- No Phones: Look, we live in 2024. Things have changed, and we know it too. I am aware that there are individuals who think that not having devices in front of you can help you focus, but I think that if you know how to properly use technology (which you should because you are in college at this point), you can do so much with it to help you learn things. His policy about no phones in class doesn't make sense to me, and personally speaking, I Google and read slides as lecturers go over lessons so that it's kind of like an aid to me and I learn more in the end. It's more about how we should use technology to facilitate and better our lives, just like how OpenAI wants us to...

I honestly have more to say about this professor, but here's my TLDR takeaway: Mr. Herman is very old-schooled, which makes the class quite a challenge for some (if not many) students like us to be able to get the grade we should get, rather than what his system thinks about us. Yes, you will learn quite a lot from Herman because he's very skilled and knowledgeable, but it's challenging and honestly you're better off getting another professor if you're taking 132 with him because it's just a LEP requirement course. And remember, I believe that just because you're skilled and smart, doesn't always mean that you're well off teaching someone about it (teaching itself is an ability that needs to be learned and mastered)."""|2

class consists of:
3 exams
surprise worksheets in discussion/lecture (mostly in discussion) free 10 point of you try on them
9 projects
class participation (2 times)
final exam

his first exam was really bad and the class average was 67. second exam was a little better and again the third was bad. the final was also hard. he put a lot of questions on end-of-semester material which threw a lot of people off. Like I said the worksheets are basically free points as long as you come to lecture. he doesn't want anyone skipping class so he uses these worksheet by giving them randomly. if you want to report an absence to make up one of the worksheets, good luck because he's really annoying about giving an excused absence. you basically use the absence website and have to wait for him to respond which he doesn't do for weeks, most likely months. his grading is a mess, most of the stuff was graded a week AFTER the final basically giving us no time to discuss our grades or see how we were doing through the semester. 

the lectures are very detailed which I liked but some of the time but sometimes he got so detailed and stuck on one thing. also theres no coding examples in lecture. he has slides he reads off of and writes on sometimes. he does post the slides but WITHOUT the stuff he wrote so its up to you to come to class and take notes. 

the TA's are awesome and honestly feel bad for them. they have to personal grade all the projects of all 500~ students because ig he doesn't want to use release test and make things simple (weird considering how much he complains about having a big course and having a hard time grading).  TA's have to give the coding examples and summarize the lectures, give us ws, and go over it all in 50 minutes. 

projects are not terrible just challenging. all his project descriptions are 9 pages long with SO MUCH EXTRA STUFF. he does offer extra credit for some of them. the secret tests make me mad because you have write a bunch of student tests and cant even figure out if you passed or not because HE DOES NOT GRADE ANYTHING!!!

overall an okay lecturer but there are no grades on time, hard exams, and make sure go to your discussion because thats the only way you'll learn. I'm really mad about my grade even though I passed the class."""|1

"""I actually really enjoyed Larry's class, lectures could be a bit boring but if you're able to pay attention he covers the material very thoroughly so going to class will help. He gives graded worksheets which you get 100 on for showing up. Project descriptions are extremely long but the detail will help you a lot, and most projects should take you maybe 2 days max. He also offers extra credit on many projects for submitting early, which should help your grade a lot.

"I actually really enjoyed Larry's class, lectures could be a bit boring but if you're able to pay attention he covers the material very thoroughly so going to class will help. He gives graded worksheets which you get 100 on for showing up. Project descriptions are extremely long but the detail will help you a lot, and most projects should take you maybe 2 days max. He also offers extra credit on many projects for submitting early, which should help your grade a lot.

"""To preface this review, I think I was a bit behind on content which is why I struggled so much with this course and why his lectures did not help my understanding. I think if you understand the concepts you will do fine, but something about this class was really difficult to understand. 
First of all, in his class format he is very particular about things and so a lot of the things that you need to do have processes to them (absence reporting for attending another lecture time, attending office hours, submitting assignments, contacting him, taking exams, etc). Also, the assignments were usually 5-10 pages of dense reading. He is very wordy and not in a super helpful detailed kind of way. A lot of what he says is more complex than what it needs to be and the amount of writing could probably be halved. Half of the difficulty with projects was reading that incredibly long document. 
He can also get distracted in lecture or feel like he is hopping around so it made it extremely hard for me to focus and something about the lectures was hard for me to digest. He will randomly comment on where people are sitting, if someone has a phone out, or to not take notes on things that will be in the slides. It pulls you out from the teaching and kind of throws you off. He is extremely repetitive.
Also, the time with which project grades are posted makes it not possible to look at that feedback to improve later projects, which will negatively impact your grade. Like I'd get points of in style for not having enough vertical whitespaces or my method comments not being detailed enough. 
Ultimately, he had a pretty hard to understand class for me. If you are relatively new to the content, I would not suggest this professor. Look elsewhere if you want someone who breaks things down more clearly and concisely. If you have plenty of prior experience with the course content, you will probably do fine. I'm sure his lecture style works well for some people but it did not work with me."""|3

"""Larry Herman was a character, but an absolute delight to have as an instructor (kindly note he is not a professor).

Pros:
- Highly structured and organized, which some can see as perhaps a bit strict, but it really is not difficult to not go on your phone for a 50 minute lecture. Having said structure helps with his exams, which are definitely fair, I would even say simpler than his practice material. Thus, if you adequately prepare and make flashcards to remember the conceptual tidbits from the lectures, your exam grades will go up for sure! I recommend writing notes during lecture, but as he says to not write everything on the slides---I found this approach really helpful to focus on what he says, and oftentimes he has a question on a slide with no answer, so to be able to answer it yourself helps greatly with the multiple choice on exams. He also has optional homeworks to help with course material, which are great resources for studying and I recommend you do them all. 
- Fair final, make sure to study hard, though.
- Free participation and worksheet grade. I say free because it is really easy to get, you only need to really participate around 3 times, which can include simply asking a question related to lecture content or so much as giving a """"no"""" if he asks a yes/no question. The worksheets are random, so you don't know if it's during lecture or discussion, but they are helpful to solidify the content, especially with specific assumptions made only for this class, and you should go to class as much as possible for these.
- Goat TAs. Shoutout Josh and Joe.
- Lengthy project descriptions. Some might say this is a con, but to have the entire project explained in a way that it is, for the most part, easy to understand EXACTLY what to do is great. It takes a bit to read through the descriptions, but it helps a lot with understanding specific projects, and Larry likes to add his little touches of humor into the project handouts which is amazing. 
- He is funny. Nice old man humor, and a great obsession with animals (I love Freddy Frog).
- He is a great lecturer. His voice may put you to sleep, but if you can fight the temptation to nap in his class, the way he explains concepts makes them so much easier to understand, and especially helps when revising later as you can hear yourself talk about the concepts in his voice. Larry knows exactly how to help you understand a concept.
- Extra credit on project submissions is really easy to get if you start early. Helps your grade a ton!

Potential Cons for You to Consider:
- Secret Tests on projects, which I find to be a pro for me since it has me examine my code better for coverage and to ensure I have everything working in the correct cases. Larry will be the first to say debugging is a skill, and it's good to start now, especially if you are new to CS, to develop this skill by putting time into these secret tests. However, you may find you only need public tests and that secret tests can be really tedious and time-consuming, thus you should consider this aspect and whether it would be a con for you.
- Not allowing electronics in class and often taking time out of lecture to call out people for using their electronics (sometimes even mistakenly calling out students with ADS accommodations).
- It can be easy and tempting to sleep in his class due to his old-fashioned lecturing style and his voice pitch.
- Some lecture material is presented in the form of handouts due to not having enough time in class. To be fair to Larry, the course has a lot of content, but I feel like certain topics kept in lecture could be sidelined to handouts, whereas the handout material could make better for lecture in certain cases, as some of the content could be confusing to someone looking at it the first time.

Cons:
- Project grading takes a WHILE. Even after the final, he still does not have a few of our project grades in. However, I think he is doing better this year when reading reviews of years past, as we only have really three project grades or so missing. This aspect could still hurt when checking your grades and seeing what you might need on the final, leading to making assumptions and predictions with Canvas' """"what-if"""" grades.
- Larry gets distracted REALLY easily, and oftentimes spends so much time in lecture calling out people for using their phones, making the same remarks about administrative resources and things outside of course material, and going """"uhhhhhhhhhhh"""" in a high-pitched voice, which is not only distracting but slows down lecture so much to the point he didn't get through all the topics he wanted to cover in the course---which, to be fair, were very minor topics, but still topics I was personally interested to learn about.

Larry also gave away chocolate during Halloween, so that was sweet. He's like a sweet, frog-loving grandpa, and I highly recommend him when he teaches 132 again in the future. I just hope he shows more love to Henry Horse next time.

Pros
 - Well written project descriptions. He is very clear about the requirements. Only negative about this is that the project descriptions are long, and you need to read them carefully multiple times.
 - Explains well during class if you pay attention. Repeats important concepts multiple times.
 - Gives a lot of practice material through discussion work sheets, homework, and practice exams. Projects also force you to practice actually coding what he's teaching in class.
 - Exams are very fair and fairly easy. Only exception is the final which had harder questions than any of the 3 midterms.

Neutral
 - Has a lot of weird policies and procedures you must follow. For examples no phones in class and no sitting in the back two rows; he will stop lecture every time and call you out if he sees this happening. Although all of his policies make sense given the circumstances in which he's teaching, it is a lot to keep track of. 
 - You can not use ELMS or email to message him. He says this is because he has a lot of students, which he does, and to contact him instead during office hours. He does have office hours 3 times a week, all of which are available via zoom, but it is kind of inconvenient to only be able to contact him at such specific times.

Cons

His exams were ok the only true hard part was his multiple choice where he doesn't tell you how many options are right. He does provide a lot of practice material and optional hws which you can use to study."|3

Also, go to the lab because a lot of the stuff in the lab was on the exams. The multiple-choice exams were weird points-wise. Everything is logical, if you understand the concepts you're in good shape to do the projects and the exams, if not go to TA office hours PLEASE, you can learn it by yourself too but I would advise you to go to office hours. Try to do well on the midterms(they shouldn't be that bad if you do the projects and the lab sheets) because the final was pretty hard."""|4

"""I felt that Mr. Herman was an amazing instructor. I know his sense of humor isn't for everyone as it can be a bit dry, but you can tell he cares about the class and wants everyone to succeed. To succeed in the course and get a great grade I will give this advice:
1. Always show up to lecture. He doesn't post videos about his lectures and it is so valuable anyways to see him talk through the problems in front of the class.
2. Get on projects early. He gives this advice throughout the semester but I can't stress it enough, one of the keys to my success in this course was doing the projects early, picking up the 6 points of extra credit, and by taking my time and writing good student tests, I consistently got 106's on the projects, which gives you a lot of wiggle room to mess up on exams.
3. Do the practice exams. Going along with point 2, do those projects, you also need to do the practice exams. His review is incredibly helpful and while it may be intimidating to tackle a 20 something pages review document, by the end of that you are going to be a pro and hopefully ace the exam. He will talk a lot in class about the importance of doing the review and he is not kidding. In my opinion it is most helpful for the MCQ section because those can have some tricky questions, but the practice exam almost certainly contains similar questions, or at least guides you on what you need to learn.

If you do these three things I feel you will be very prepared and his class should be a pretty straight-forward A. 

So concluding about Mr. Herman:
- He posts super helpful review material and valuable projects
- His lectures will help you learn the material really well
- He loves frogs (a lot!)"""|5

They also have extra credit if u submit once and 2 days before the submit date. I suggest you go for these since it helps in the long run. Also you have to participate twice that's it. Third, the tests are like the practice tests. Please study the practice tests its so helpful and he does a amazing job making sure the practice test lines up with the real test.

The other most important thing to do in this class is to ask questions when something isn't clear.  In each class there's usually 2-6 little insights he forgets to mention, if you can catch those omissions and get him to explain them, you are a hero and it will be tremendously insightful for you and for every other student in the room.  Although if you still don't get his explanation, you may need to just let it go- and if you took good notes, you should eventually understand it when you are reviewing them later."""|4

"""Lecture:
Kruskal seemed to be a little out of his element this semester (Spring 2012). He supposedly never uses power point, but was forced to because Meesh said her class and his class had to keep up with each other. I didn't really learn much from the power point slides, most of the interesting tricks came when Kruskal would steer away and do one of his 'fun' problems. 
He was disorganized and late to every class. I honestly don't know how I learned during lecture, but I did. So I would suggest going to lecture (no pop quizzes or anything like that though). 

Homework:
Assigned weekly, and very hard. I took MATH310 and MATH406 (A+ in both) already, and I thought this homework was very difficult. 

Quizzes:
On Monday's during discussion. Usually pretty easy, just look over the slides.

Exams:
the midterms were long, I kind of finished them, but I didn't really get to check my answers.

Final:
He randomly gave us 2 hours and 7 minutes to finish the final. When I asked him why he just said """"I have my reasons"""" which is the response he gives to just about everything...
The exam itself was not that bad, I got a 90% but the class average was a 60%. It was only a little bit longer than the midterms, but it was harder. 

**Finally I would like to say that I considered testing out of this class, since I was a math major I could have probably passed the placement exam. But I wanted the free 4 credit A. Turns out this class is not a free 4 credit A no matter how much math you know. Kruskal makes the homeworks too hard for that. That being said I think that you should take this class rather than test out of it, I learned a lot of stuff (especially Induction stuff, which isn't covered very well by the math dept. but Kruskal did a extensive covering of induction).

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
I also had Kruskal for 351:

He did a much better job in 351 than he did in 250. I think he just wasn't really into the 250 stuff. In 351 his exams and HW were very hard, but he curves like crazy so don't worry about it (like a 60% = B for our class). This seems weird, but it is done because it is hard to test algorithms. 

The only thing I didn't like was that there was one midterm that was 40% of my grade, the final was 50% and homeworks were 1% each.

On exams if you are asked to make-up an algorithm on the spot just make one that works and disregard efficiency, you get a lot of points for one that works. Efficiency will get you more points, but just move onto the next question and try for efficiency if you have more time at the end of the exam."""|4

"""Dr. Kruskal is a terrible professor. For algorithms, he did not teach nearly as much as any other professor. Looking at material from other semester, he did not cover as much material NOR covered it as deeply. He would refuse to do proofs under the mindset that they were not instructive. Even when he did attempt them, the proofs were so terrible I didn't even bother writing them down. He would always be minutes late, and would often spend the last chunk of classes doing unrelated material further wasting time.

This being said, our semester also had many terribly harsh graders for TA's. The class up to the final was pretty straight forward. The midterm was not too difficult, and the weekly homeworks were usually doable and he accepted resubmissions (and very late submissions). The final exam was incredibly difficult and harshly graded. The mean was a 45, and the final cut offs for passing the course was a 37, and for an A-, a 67.

In the end, going to lectures and doing the homework is still crucial. He does not offer any other manner of learning the little he did go over in the semester, such as online notes, so not going to lecture makes getting a decent grade nearly impossible. I would not recommend him. He makes the class just as difficult as the other professors, but you end up learning less in the end. It might be a little less work with the somewhat small weekly homeworks, but it is not worth it in the end."""|2

"""It's very important to accept that Kruskal simply operates on a different wavelength from the average person. He's a true mathematician in the sense that he experiences life abstractly and disregards some aspects of interaction in favor of maintaining his flow of reasoning.

The honors section was an intimate and fun experience, and I can see how Kruskal might be more difficult in a large lecture, or with students who are less enthusiastic or willing/able to follow the material. So I highly recommend the honors class for the abstract-thinker. The assessments and graded assignments are the same, but you get to spend half the time solving logical puzzles."""|5

The class had no structure, either a student would remind him where he left off the class before, or he would just start in a seemingly random place.

""""Clyde,"""" as I sometimes hear other students call him (not my style), is friendly, even solicitous, in person; although at times I was very frustrated with him I never had a bad impression of him as a person. 

But almost everything else about the course, including his teaching style, left me unhappy and on-edge. Among other things, at the end of the course I received a grade better than a B - the night before, I had calculated the likely cutoff for a C-, because I was *that* unsure where my not-yet-graded final exam performance left me. A member of my friend-group was dumbstruck to receive a 50% on one exam (exams are far-and-away the bulk of your grade in this course), only to discover that he had been misgraded by about 30% - that is, he actually earned an 80. 

To avoid going over-length with anecdotes, some key complaints/corresponding survival tips:

- TAs are perennially unhelpful (make sure you work with other students)
- Exam questions draw heavily on homeworks, so successfully understanding homework (no matter how vague or slow-grading TAs might be) is important to get done before exams
- Grading is slow and curves aren't specified until the very end (avoid panicking, and monitor where you are with respect to the average; for reference, 75% earned you an A in my semester)
- Make sure you understand the rudiments of calculus (how integrals are approximated with sums, for example) and summation-handling, because this knowledge will be largely assumed in derivations
- Our final exam was largely *not* cumulative, and what did show up was more trivia we'd all forgotten than anything substantive (all I can hint here is to take note of """"space complexity"""" during the course)
- TAs frequently pull the hardest exam questions from websites like """"geeksforgeeks,"""" interview-type questions for professionals; studying at least a few of these will give you a fighting chance of solving the problems in real time
- The textbook is sometimes helpful but always a pain to read; if you anticipate trouble, start reading in advance
- This course often tends towards the frustrating; instead, try to have fun - really the best thing about this course is it encourages on-the-spot facility with making a good algorithm to solve a problem you encounter, which is a cool skill to have

Sadly, I could still say more, but I think I've gone on long enough.

"""Clyde's class is difficult. His homeworks are the same as Eastman's, but different from Jason's. I found that the """"prep"""" and the self-study sheets that Jason would post around midterms or throughout the semester were very helpful if you did all the problems listed. Most of the exam problems look just like the ones on the practice midterms but expect a few curveballs.

As an instructor, Clyde is objectively frustrating to follow. He'll take examples from the slides and change them so that if you don't pay close attention the whole time, you may end up lost. 

Asking questions in class is good. He won't demoralize you if you have the balls to ask a question, but if you try and answer a question that HE asks, and you get it even slightly wrong, he will not be forgiving. Just before Thanksgiving, he taught a lecture that was like an intro to algorithms, and there were only 15 of us in class that day (weather was bad and it was the day before break). I guessed the answer to one of his problems, and upon learning that I got it wrong, he followed it up with """"I guess you really don't know anything."""" It's objectively a terrible teaching tactic, but the TA's will be a lot more helpful in giving constructive feedback during discussions or office hours.

My tips for surviving the Clyde:

1. I definitely wouldn't have survived without this. Go to discussion. The TA's will go over problems more in-depth than he does and will answer your questions without ridicule. I personally never went to office hours but if that's your thing hey more power to you.
2. Do problems from the textbook to prepare for exams. I got a 78 on the first midterm when I didn't do this, and then a 98 on the second when I cracked open the book.
3. Look back at the homework to get an idea of the types of questions that can come up on exams. Oftentimes, midterm problems will be carbon copies of these with a few words or numbers changed.
4. Follow along during lecture on a laptop with the lecture slides. I found it helpful to get some notes a minute or two in advance of him covering it. Side note - Jason makes the slides and Clyde lectures on it, so that's why it seems like he's only reading it for the first time. Also, Clyde will sometimes skip over a lot of slides at once because he feels it's not important, but it can be helpful to get a couple more examples under your belt while he's rambling.
5. Try to keep your cool. Clyde is so frustrating, I can't stress this enough, but if you're taking his class, the best you can do is get your bearings and learn more in-depth on your own time (which honestly can be during lecture).

I hated his class, but I'm taking 351 next semester with him because I'm a freshman and register last so wish me luck."""|2
"Clyde's class is difficult. His homeworks are the same as Eastman's, but different from Jason's. I found that the """"prep"""" and the self-study sheets that Jason would post around midterms or throughout the semester were very helpful if you did all the problems listed. Most of the exam problems look just like the ones on the practice midterms but expect a few curveballs.

As an instructor, Clyde is objectively frustrating to follow. He'll take examples from the slides and change them so that if you don't pay close attention the whole time, you may end up lost. 

Asking questions in class is good. He won't demoralize you if you have the balls to ask a question, but if you try and answer a question that HE asks, and you get it even slightly wrong, he will not be forgiving. Just before Thanksgiving, he taught a lecture that was like an intro to algorithms, and there were only 15 of us in class that day (weather was bad and it was the day before break). I guessed the answer to one of his problems, and upon learning that I got it wrong, he followed it up with """"I guess you really don't know anything."""" It's objectively a terrible teaching tactic, but the TA's will be a lot more helpful in giving constructive feedback during discussions or office hours.

My tips for surviving the Clyde:

1. I definitely wouldn't have survived without this. Go to discussion. The TA's will go over problems more in-depth than he does and will answer your questions without ridicule. I personally never went to office hours but if that's your thing hey more power to you.
2. Do problems from the textbook to prepare for exams. I got a 78 on the first midterm when I didn't do this, and then a 98 on the second when I cracked open the book.
3. Look back at the homework to get an idea of the types of questions that can come up on exams. Oftentimes, midterm problems will be carbon copies of these with a few words or numbers changed.
4. Follow along during lecture on a laptop with the lecture slides. I found it helpful to get some notes a minute or two in advance of him covering it. Side note - Jason makes the slides and Clyde lectures on it, so that's why it seems like he's only reading it for the first time. Also, Clyde will sometimes skip over a lot of slides at once because he feels it's not important, but it can be helpful to get a couple more examples under your belt while he's rambling.

"""Coming into this class, I knew what to expect with Kruskal because I had him for CMSC250. He seems like a great guy and he really knows what he is teaching, but I do not find him to be a good teacher. However, I can see why others would disagree. His lecture style seems to work very well for some and not at all for others. I definitely fall into the second category. 

Although I stopped attending his lectures early on, I was able to do well in the class by taking the homework assignments seriously, watching a lot of YouTube videos, and watching the Panopto recordings from the other professor. I don't mind learning this way and Kruskal's exams are very fair (even if they are hard) because they are based almost solely on the homeworks. But if you are someone who prefers to learn directly from the lectures instead of someone who learns by struggling through homeworks, I would not recommend taking Kruskal."""|3

Again, exam review material is something that was easily made for 351, so I am shocked that they couldn't apply the same processes here to make it."|3

His """"class times"""" were just 1 to 1.5 hours of him doing problems that are irrelevant to the lecture or homework material. The homework material was always based on an advanced version of lecture material that you did not learn how to do.

Our midterm average as a class was a 44. The final exam average as a class was never released, but the entire class' grades were so bad that they lowered the final C range to a 41 in the class. The previous semester had their 'C' range lowered to a 50, which is apparently the normal passing range for his classes. Alongside all of this, Kruskal does not answer emails or his phone. He hardly ever responds to the TA's, but every single bit of communication to you comes through the TA's including his """"office hours"""" which is actually just """"TA hours."""" To top it all off at the end of the semester, Kruskal posted incorrect letter grades to everyone's transcripts based on our unweighted number grades. More than half the class had 'D' or 'F' posted to their transcripts when they had actually passed with a 'C' or higher. It has been over one month since the class has ended and the Chair of Computer Science as well as the Dean of Computer Science have just admitted that they can't fix students' grades because Kruskal will not answer his phone or emails to confirm with anyone from the school that he messed up. Because of this, many students from the class got deregistered from their next semester's classes because they currently (and incorrectly) do not meet pre-requisite requirements.

Summary of this review: Kruskal does not care about the students. He is a tenured professor that is forced to show up and provide """"something"""" to his students. He does not care if anyone learns the material, he will not communicate with you, and he seems to enjoy causing immense stress.

I highly recommend going to class because I think it helps you practice how to find solutions. 

The quizzes were often dumb gotchas, but there is one every class, they total like 6% of your grade, and a significant portion of them (maybe around 5) are dropped. 

Exams are pretty gnarly. Average is usually between 50% and 60%.

"""- He pre-records pretty much all of his lectures. Sometimes the lectures are clear and well-made, but mostly he uses in-class recordings from a couple of years ago, which can be frustrating to watch because of poor audio. The actual content of his lectures are OK though, and I'd say he's overall a decent lecturer. 
- The class sessions are used to go over assignments and any extra ramblings. This flipped classroom approach seems nice at first, but the problem is that he assigns a quiz that is due before every class, so you pretty much have to dedicate an hour or two before the class to actually watch the lecture and take the quiz, in addition to the time that you're already spending on homework assignments and studying. 
- Exams are crap. Averages are usually in the mid 50s, and make up around 80-85% of your grade (the rest of your grade comes from homework/pre-class quizzes). The fortunate side of this is that Kruskal grades with a huge curve, so you're usually not at risk of outright failing if you're doing about average. In the past, exams used to be based heavily on homeworks, but that seems to have changed this semester, with exams having new problems that are only loosely based on previous homeworks. He also seems to have added a number of different topics this semester that he doesn't usually cover, and this was particularly frustrating because many of the TAs and GSS leaders did not have any familiarity with the material at the tail-end of the semester. 
- He outsources pretty much all of his course operations to his TAs, aside from lectures and homework/exam writing. This was probably one of the most frustrating parts of the course, because the TA team is woefully understaffed and left most of our homeworks ungraded until after finals week. I do not understand how 330 had almost 20 TAs and 351 has barely 10, most of whom are other undergrads who have obligations with their own courses. Seriously, this is one of the most ridiculous parts of this class - please hire more TAs. 
- Kruskal himself is a nice guy and is flexible + willing to help. I would highly encourage people to go to the actual classes/lectures to stay engaged and to get help from him directly. 

Tl;dr - Kruskal is a nice guy and a decent lecturer overall. This class is highly disorganized, has difficult exams, far too few TAs, and content that is pretty boring and occasionally difficult to understand. If you can take this course with Justin or Teli, take it with them."""|2

The homework can sometimes be frustrating but he allows us to work in groups which I would highly recommend doing. He is also a nice professor to talk to after class or during office hours.

The exams expect that you will be able to come up with efficient algorithms that are different than ones seen on the homework which makes them difficult to study for. You can't just memorize and regurgitate information from class and expect to do well, but if that was the case, I think it could defeat the whole point of the class.

"""I was in Maksym's section, but both Kruskal and Maksym co-taught 351 and the class was run pretty much exactly like Kruskal's class except for a different curve, and having been to Kruskal's lectures, office hours and studying his material for the bulk of the semester, I figured it's better to write a review for Kruskal's class here as well.

I think Kruskal's material is fine. His homeworks are definitely hard, but if you go to the TA's or especially Kruskal's office hours, they will explain what the problems mean. And that's really it, Kruskal's problems are all about understanding of the material. What this problem wants us to do, what this algorithm does, why this algorithm behaves such a way, what this problem accomplishes, and why this problem is relevant, etc. If you truly understand that, then Kruskal's 351 homeworks and exams will come off pretty easy. As for the notorious last """"coding interview"""" problem on the exams, if you can do Leetcode problems without difficulty, you will do well :). But jokes aside, these """"interview"""" questions get a lot of hate because there's really no way to prepare or study for these questions, but like I said, if you understand what this problem is trying to accomplish, then they should come off pretty easy. It's all about critical thinking, testing whether you can come up with an efficient solution, and you will get partial credit even when you write a brute force solution. Kruskal doesn't want you to write 50-100 line of code that does complex stuff, the solutions to his coding problems are always simple pseudocode. Kruskal may be very disorganized and just not good at administering class, but he is seriously one of the most knowledgeable people in the faculty, and you will learn a lot when you go to Kruskal's office hours. He's been teaching and researching algorithm and theory for decades, and it shows.

Kruskal emphasizes in thinking about the problems and how to solve them creatively. You won't do well on the exams from rote memorization and regurgitation. The problems may be challenging, but you gain so much once you solve them. I don't think Kruskal's 351 is impossible. What decides on your performance in this class is psychological. If you approach this class by just mindlessly taking notes and cram the night before, you are not going to do well. If you rely on simple memorization, you are not going to do well on the exams. Also, getting 65 and 70 is a good thing. Whether this grading system is a good idea is debatable, but don't stress about the raw score just because you were used to getting scores of 80+. It's all relative, and I don't think it's a bad thing. The interview question at the end of the exam, which is something not a majority of the students get full credit in, is also accounted for, and the class is heavily curved. The pass/fail rate for Kruskal's 351 is also comparable to any other CS classes.

What I'm saying is that you don't need to be too scared when going into CMSC351 with Kruskal. It's really not that bad, and it has its reputation because the class is just, different. CMSC351 is one of the first CS classes that requires you to think critically unlike 100 level and 200 level classes. If you figure that out, you will do well.

One thing I will note about 351 is that it is very poorly structured. It's not about exams taking 80%+ of the course but really more about the content of 351. 351 is too much math and analysis heavy, and I do wish the class teach more interesting stuff like dynamic programming instead of spending too much time on sorting algorithms, constructive induction, and NP etc. The way Kruskal structured 351 is pretty unique and arguably odd compared to algorithm classes at other CS schools. But then again, the whole CS curriculum at UMD needs some fixing.

Also, Kruskal is quite sarcastic and a pretty funny guy. He'll be very helpful when you go to his office hours, so don't be too harsh on him."""|4
"I was in Maksym's section, but both Kruskal and Maksym co-taught 351 and the class was run pretty much exactly like Kruskal's class except for a different curve, and having been to Kruskal's lectures, office hours and studying his material for the bulk of the semester, I figured it's better to write a review for Kruskal's class here as well.

I think Kruskal's material is fine. His homeworks are definitely hard, but if you go to the TA's or especially Kruskal's office hours, they will explain what the problems mean. And that's really it, Kruskal's problems are all about understanding of the material. What this problem wants us to do, what this algorithm does, why this algorithm behaves such a way, what this problem accomplishes, and why this problem is relevant, etc. If you truly understand that, then Kruskal's 351 homeworks and exams will come off pretty easy. As for the notorious last """"coding interview"""" problem on the exams, if you can do Leetcode problems without difficulty, you will do well :). But jokes aside, these """"interview"""" questions get a lot of hate because there's really no way to prepare or study for these questions, but like I said, if you understand what this problem is trying to accomplish, then they should come off pretty easy. It's all about critical thinking, testing whether you can come up with an efficient solution, and you will get partial credit even when you write a brute force solution. Kruskal doesn't want you to write 50-100 line of code that does complex stuff, the solutions to his coding problems are always simple pseudocode.

"""I had Kruskal for 351 when he was co-teaching it with Morawski.

Pros:
- His recorded lectures are pretty decent. Some are recorded in the classroom and the video quality isn't great, but some are great, very clear, and with helpful slides.
- He is apparently helpful when you go to office hours in person.
- The class is pretty tough but there's a decent curve at the end that takes it into account.

Cons:
- His in-person lectures, unfortunately, are not great. He spends around half the class on tangents about unrelated things, and a good chunk of the other half is spent on going over the homework. Going over the homework is great, of course, but I found he spent a lot of time on the things that weren't as necessary to explain in detail, and not a lot on things that were necessary to explain in detail.
- The fact that we had to watch both recorded lectures and in-person lectures meant we were supposed to spend almost twice as much time on 351 as on normal classes. Eventually, I stopped going to in-person lectures, but that did mean missing out on answers to past homeworks/quizzes/exams.
- Some concepts are overcomplicated, such as recurrences (the whole president/vice president/supervisor thing just made it harder to understand)
- He also often doesn't tell you the intended answers to tough quiz/exam questions when discussing the quiz/exam afterwards.
- His responses on Piazza were often not very helpful (he found it hard to understand students' questions)
- Administratively, the class is a mess. There's not enough TAs, it takes a ridiculously long time for grades on anything to come back, instructions on homeworks are often unclear.
- The final exam is a huge part of your grade.
- He soemtimes uses terms with his own definitions, so when you Google it, either nothing relevant pops up or it turns out everyone other than Kruskal uses that term differently.

Overall, not the worst professor ever, but take someone else if you can. The fact that his class is harder does NOT mean he is a better instructor and you'll learn more - you'll have to do a lot of self-studying. That said, he isn't as much of a nightmare as people make him out to be, as long as you're okay with a minor hit to your GPA."""|2

"""Kruskal is my favorite professor in the CS department, his lectures are really informative, engaging, and its coming from the person who helped develop a lot of the content you are learning about. The course is weighted 90% for midterms and the final, and I truly believe that if he graded easier he would have much better ratings. The exams are not hard if you understand and do the homework. The homework and NP problem set were really interesting assignments that often covered material not taught in class. I can understand that people don't like guessing what they need to do for homework, but I really enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of them.

Overall, cool dude and interesting class. You will learn a lot if you take the class with Kruskal."""|5

"""I took CMSC351: Algorithms (requirement CS course) with Clyde Kruskal in Fall 2023

On your journey towards that sweet six-figure SWE FAANG job, you will encounter one of the most notorious bosses - Clyde Kruskal.

Is he really as bad as the other reviews make him out to be, you wonder. 
Surely he can't be that bad?

No.
Over the years he has just gotten worse, slowly giving up on giving any pretense of actually a decent education. 
e.g. in Fall 2019 there was a class website, syllabus, practice problems, everything https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc351-201/
In Fall 2023 there wasn't even a syllabus.

He will shatter your already low expectations in the other direction and demonstrate that he is even worse.

But you probably know all this already. Nobody takes Kruskal willingly. You are only here because you have no choice and you do not want to delay taking CMSC351 to next semester to get a better professor (which you could if you plan it right, but I never did). 

So here is what actually matters which is advice on how to survive Kruskal / what I would have done differently if I could do it again: 

- Give up all hope that you will be helped by TAs / Kruskal office hours. TAs will either be very kind and nice but not know anything, or just find it very funny that you are suffering, or not show up. As it is there are not enough TAs for anything. Kruskal used to be helpful in the past apparently (as per previous reviews) but these days is just very snarky and refuses to even give a basic response in the right direction. Sure Kruskal you can't just give me the answer but I would have really appreciated if you just guided me in the right direction otherwise what's the point of coming to your office hours?

- Go to lecture the first week, then never again. It is a waste of time.

- Take those three hours you free up each week, add three more, and MAKE SURE YOU GRIND HIS ONLINE RECORDINGS LIKE A 
MANIAC. This is your new religion, make sure you MASTER those videos.

- Join the dominant Discord server for the class.

- Take the thrice-weekly multiple choice quizzes as an opportunity to make sure you learn from the videos and watch the videos (as he intends you to). Do NOT do something like try to do them at the last minute by coding up the sorting algorithm or asking your friends, the most important thing is that you master the videos. 

- Your friends in the Discord server are your only resource and hope. Share all your homework answers with them (don't worry it's allowed) and make sure they share with you. If your friends don't want to do that then join another Discord server or find new friends. 

- Post on Piazza if you want but estimate only a 10% chance of actually getting useful information in return. 

- If falling behind, ask for an extension on Piazza for whatever (he is generous with that on a whole-class level at least, so be bold and ask). 

- Religiously practice the homeworks done before each exam. Remember that the exams, including the final, are NOT CUMULATIVE. Kruskal will never clarify the syllabus but it will be based on the practice exam (x1) and the homeworks that immediately precede that particular exam. 

- Do not worry about your quizzes, they are worthless anyway (0.2% each, lowest dropped). It's a red herring, the biggest fish to fry are the exams (2 midterms, 1 final, all two hours each). 

- The class is graded on a curve, the median is B- one standard deviation above is cutoff for A (or A- I forgot), one deviation below is the cutoff for passing (getting a C-). 
The only indicator of your progress the entire semester that you should insist and fight for (everything else give up on) (forget about it, you're not getting that homework graded before the end of the semester) is the statistics for the exams. 
Ensure that you are within one standard deviation from below for the class to pass.

- Accept that 50% is the average. Literally 50%, if that is the median, will get you a B-. I don't know why everyone worries about this, this isn't your Nelson class where you can get a perfect score on every exam. Don't be ashamed, remember the bigger picture.

Good luck"""|1

"""This semester Kruskal has changed. Students call him Lord Kruskal most of the time.
Style: attendance is optional. Students watch recorded lectures, take a quiz on GradeScope, and then go to class if they want to discuss and review the topic.
You have 8 regular HWs (5%) + 6 NP HWs (regarding NP-Completeness which we study from time to time) (5%) + 31 short quizzes on GradeScope (10%) + 2 midterms (25% each) + non-cumulative final (30%).
If a student asks for an extension, he gives an extension for the whole class. One time he extended a HW 3 days that was already extended 4 days just because a student wanted to go to a party on a Friday night.
The average was 50 for Mid_1, 60 for Mid_2, and 57 for final. Don't worry, the curve average is B.
Organization: At the beginning of each week, he posts a schedule for topics of the week, what recorded lectures to watch, what quizzes to solve, and what deadlines are upcoming. TAs graded HWs at a good pace, around every 3 weeks maybe. We finished the semester with only one NP HW not graded yet.

I highly recommend taking 351 with Kruskal."""|4

"""Kruskal actually challenged me a lot this past semester (Fall 23), but I feel like I became a better student because of him. His class is challenging, and his lack of administrative intiative is frustrating at times, but he will teach you important concepts, and also concepts that you simply ask him about. His class doesn't spoon feed you, so if you do end up taking him because the other classes are full, how you do is solely based on you. If you work hard, you can do good. If you're just super smart, then it'll be very doable. Many smart students would get 90s or 100s on his exams, when the average was a 50 or 60. Personally, if you just put in the work and study you can score around 1 standard deviation above the average which will get you close or at the A- to A range. A lot of the questions on his exams ask you about certain techniques covered in his lectures and homeworks, others are more creative algorithm questions but if you miss those, it's fine. A lot of people do, and since the class is curved, missing those doesn't kill you. I could go on and on about Kruskal, but to sum it up, he's a smart old computer scientist who can help challenge you to become a better computer scientist. It's possible to do well in his class, you just have to work hard."""|5

"""I was scared shitless before starting this class because of all the reviews I read on here. I thought this class would destroy me and...it didn't??

I'll start with this: his exams are *not hard*. For reference, I got A's on the first two exams (before the curve), and like 60 something on the final (I didn't really study so that was on me). His midterms were largely just homework problems with some minor modifications. His interview questions weren't actually that bad, although I think we got easier interview questions than usual.

I didn't show up to lecture until like halfway through October, and I did just fine. I didn't start going to lecture until after midterm 1 (because I needed to get out of the dorm more). His lecturing is honestly really good. His in-person lectures were a little disorganized but that doesn't really matter much because none of the assignments are on the in-person lectures; just the video lectures.

He's also very nice. He's not perfect, but he's much better than most people make him out to be. Also the TA's were pretty awesome.

The homework difficulty varied a lot. Around half of the homeworks were very easy (you could knock them out in 45-60 minutes), the other half were quite tough.

Don't worry that much about Kruskal's class. I would actually recommend taking Kruskal. I think a lot of people get it in their heads, before even beginning the class, that the class is going to be really hard and whatnot. It's not. Don't freak out. Just watch the videos, understand them (and they're pretty easy to understand because Kruskal is very good at explaining), and you'll be fine."""|4

I think a lot of people get it in their heads, before even beginning the class, that the class is going to be really hard and whatnot. It's not. Don't freak out. Just watch the videos, understand them (and they're pretty easy to understand because Kruskal is very good at explaining), and you'll be fine."|4

"""I had Li for CMSC433 in the spring of 2022. Originally, this class was supposed to be taught by Dr. Mamat, but he ended up leaving the university. After his departure, the department didn't have anyone to take over the class, but Li (who is a postdoc, not technically a professor) was listed as the new instructor a few weeks before the start of the semester. The first half of the class was pretty easy. Li himself was not a great lecturer, but the projects and homework were easy enough, and there was a decent amount of extra credit offered as well. 

Halfway through the semester, Li significantly changed the material from previous iterations of 433 and began teaching extensively about program verification, type inferencing, and other topics that had little to do with the typical content of 433 (which is supposed to be a class about concurrency/parallelism). The course content itself was still about the same difficulty (IMO), but his lectures were so awful that it was difficult to understand even the simplest concepts presented, and the topics discussed were so niche that it was difficult to find other resources to learn the material. The TAs were also of little help, since most of them were also trying to learn the new concepts as well. The projects and homework for the latter half of the semester were also boring and difficult (again, not because the concepts themselves were necessarily difficult, but because Li's lectures were so bad that it was difficult to know where to even start), and Li was frequently condescending in his responses to student requests for project extensions. According to him, since he was able to complete the project quickly, that must mean that students in the class should also be able to complete the project quickly - never mind the fact that Li has completed a PhD on this material and that getting help from TAs would sometimes take hours because of backlogs in office hours. 

I ended up with an A in this class thanks to the extra credit offered, but in my view, that doesn't make up for a semester's worth of extremely poor teaching, boring projects, and unhelpful, condescending responses to student concerns."""|1

- course content is not difficult; the sheer amount of assignments is what makes the class difficult
- Professor Li is VERY responsive on Piazza. Between the professor and the TAs, posts usually don't sit unanswered for more than a few hours. Same goes on weekends too, though maybe a longer response time
- Lectures are recorded and are posted to elms with the slides
- online + open notes exams

CONS: 
- Each week you'll either have 2 or 3 things due or nothing due. If there's nothing due one week there's a big project due the following week.

"""Have you ever wanted to waste a semester learning nothing, but still be so stressed about a class you nearly get an ulcer? Do you want a teacher who will be rude and condescending to you and ignore all your concerns? Is your life missing a teacher who is utterly incapable of explaining the material and steadfastly refuses to answer your questions in any comprehensible way? Look no further than Liyi Li, the worst teacher bar none at the University of Maryland, perhaps in the world! His existence is proof positive that God is real and He Hates CS Students. 

Dr. Li demonstrated every single day in class that he did not understand the material any better than the students did, or that if he did, he was so utterly incapable of communicating the material that we just assumed that lecture was the first time he was seeing it. Asking him questions didn't help as, assuming he didn't just ignore your question, he regularly failed to answer it in any meaningful way or even rephrase the confusing material in a way that could be better understood. Lecture slides are utterly useless for learning due to being incomprehensible.

Going to TAs to learn the material doesn't help either as they don't understand it either - though that's not their fault; he so completely fails to impart even the smallest nugget of information on whoever he is talking to that even they don't understand what was going on in the class Often the TAs were forced to just give out the answers left and right to students or almost the entire class would fail.

We regularly had 3-4 projects assigned to us at a time on top of regular homeworks. Projects might be due mere days apart from one another without any office hours between them to discuss the project with the TAs. When students complain, his go-to responses are """"well a few people finished the project on the first day, so why can't you?"""" and """"you students are lazy and just want the TAs to do all the work for you."""" He insisted on using software that by his own admission was broken and regularly discarded your work before you could save it.

To """"make up"""" for the technology issues he simply allows you ~2x the normal time to take exams. If you have another class or exam right after and can't use that extra time, tough luck, you're screwed. Who cares? Not Dr. Li. You doing poorly on an exam is just another example that proves his belief that students at UMD are idiots (literally something he has said to his TAs).

If I could give this man fewer than 1/5 stars I would - he's one of the few professors on PlanetTerp with 1-star reviews across the board. Do yourself a favor and avoid him at all costs."""|1

"""I took this couse in Fall 2022, and having now graduated, I can now safely say that Li is the worst professor that I have had the displeasure of having, CS or otherwise.

Pros:
+ Sometimes when responding on Piazza, Li gets to fed up, that he will just post answers to graded assignments
+ Exams are online
+ Late policy: 20% docked off, but you get an additional four days to complete the project. Since the 20% penalty is flat, regardless if you take 1 or 4 days, it is pretty generous as far as late policies go

Cons:
- Li is a horrible lecturer. Some reviewers below mention his accent, and while that is an issue, I feel like the bigger issue here is that Li can't properly explain any concept for the life of him. He essentially just reads off the slides without elaborating further on any concept. Whenever he does attempt to try to explain something, it just ends up muddying things up.
- Many crucial processes (ex. combining bucchi automata) are not explained
- There are too many assignments. The class has major programming assignments, prelecture assignments, and HW assignments. Weeks can have as many as four assignments due, but since each type of assignment is due at a different frequency, it's hard to determine what's due when. In general, it is simply a lot of work
- There are too many websites with assignments/announcements with no centralization in where everything can be found. The class had as many as four sites active at once, each with different stuff and no reminders about due assignments. It is extremely easy to miss assignments.
- He claims you get 2 weeks to do every major programming project, but since multiple programming projects are active at a time, you really only are spending one week on each, since the previous week is spent on the previous project. One week is not sufficient.
- Announcements on finals were confusing. Additional clarification was required on exam timings, and he kept saying that there would be zoom proctoring, only for him to randomly not do it at the last second."""|1

"""I guess Anwar's gone now, but in case he comes back...

I would say he's a good lecturer. My main complaint would be that he never really slows down. We would go through a huge amount of slides everyday and sometimes it seemed like he was racing. 330 has a lot of content, so that's probably why. I don't personally take notes, but I don't think anyone could with how fast he goes. He still did a good job at explaining concepts and the slides were well made, so you could basically just study off of those. He was clearly frustrated this semester by the turnout in lecture. Clicker quizzes used to be 4% of the grade, basically making lecture attendance mandatory. They changed the policy in the first week of the semester I believe, since people could be in and out with COVID. He would make lots of comments to himself during lecture about how it's so hard to teach this semester with not that many people in lecture and with everyone wearing masks. I also guess that computers used to not be allowed in 330 lecture, but now they are? He would complain about people having computers out too sometimes, and how he couldn't do anything.

The projects in this class weren't very difficult, except for the NFA to DFA project and maybe the first OCaml project. If you start early, you should be fine. There were two online midterms which were pretty fair. We had four 20 minute online quizzes in the semester that I found to be very difficult. 20 minutes was not enough time and they seemed a bit unnecessary (the last quiz was on a topic on the last midterm, which was a week before). The final was also in-person for some reason. People would complain on Piazza and the TAs said that the decision was made by the instructors. People tried to ask Mamat/Eastman to change it to in-person and they said they would think about, but they did nothing. Not a good look on their part, considering the online midterms were open book and this wasn't. Plus, many people expressed COVID concerns due to a in-person final, which was also ignored.

All in all, if Anwar comes back, I would recommend him. I was planning on taking 433 with him, but they changed teachers. He seems to have been a bit disillusioned by teaching this semester by all his comments on lecture, but I do hope he comes back."""|4

Early on in the semester it was a little rough because it was his first time teaching after a couple years working, but once he got into it I really learned a lot.

"""Don't get me wrong, Anwar seems like a genuinely nice and intelligent guy. That being said, he is one of the worst computer science professors I've had at UMD. CMSC 330 by itself is notoriously disorganized. They seem to change the syllabus and languages covered every semester, never seeming quite certain about what they are going to do over the 15 weeks and jolting around during lectures. Everything is so haphazard and nothing is properly communicated. There are four quizzes during the lecture and they always cover content that was poorly taught during the lectures that happened that week specifically. There is rarely any time given to actually absorb the content before the quizzes. Projects vary, some being hard and others much easier. Most of the projects will have to be self study because they barely cover what we need to know for them during lecture. Anwar himself is a poor lecturer. He zooms through slides and is always flipping between a powerpoint and a terminal or just freeballing and using his web browser. Because of this it never seems like he has a solid idea of what he's trying to cover during the lecture. The resources given to us are also super messy. I feel like 1/3 of the content we need to know is actually taught and the other 2/3 are scattered across random GIT repositories, massive slide decks that are only half covered in class, or other notes. You will feel lost and alone in the course and there is no one really to help you except your friends who are taking it too. The exams oscillated between very fair and very challenging, with some questions seeming near impossible to finish. Cliff doesn't seem much better and they co-teach the course so good luck to any soldier who has to take it. I very much hope the entire department wakes up and realizes that this is their worst course, but seeing how these problems have persisted for the last 5+ years I highly doubt it."""|1

"""Not a bad teacher and the course isn't too bad either. It's 5 coding projects, one midterm, and one final project that was easy. There's also gradescope quizzes that aren't hard. Takes a while to grade though, and some of the descriptions for projects weren't that clear since they were written this semester. The midterm was also tough, most people didn't do well."""|4

"""I really liked the class, Anwar is super fun and engaging even if the content can be kind of boring at times. He doesn't do clicker quizzes anymore and now its lecture quizzes that you can do in groups that are assigned over the weekends (they're basically a free 100). There is also a lot of extra credit, 1% for participating in discussion, and 1% if 90% of students do the course evals at the end of the semester. Projects are also worth almost half of your total grade which is great cause it makes it a lot easier to get a good great. I got a 70 on the first exam and still ended up with an A because of all the stuff I just mentioned. If you're choosing between cliff and anwar it won't really matter too much, both are decent teachers"""|5

"""For the Fall 2024 semester, Dr Mamat and Cliff cotaught using Cliffs resources, course organization, and exam styles. Dr Mamat got rid of the clicker quizzes our semester and stopped recording lectures, which I didn’t mind because I went to almost every lecture. Dr Mamat was funny, but his lectures tended to be disorganized. I found them to be very intuitive when he was typing examples into emacs, but he was flipping through his slides, I felt lost. The projects are hard but they teach you the content very well. The exams are fair. Overall, Dr Mamat is a solid choice for this class."""|4

"""Anwar is a pretty good professor, he keeps his class fun and engaging and he's a pretty nice guy. He spends most of lecture typing code, which I think was nice but also made it a little difficult for me to take organized and helpful notes that I could actually use later. I would definitely recommend taking notes in a google doc or something on your laptop where you can type so that you can actually keep up with everything he's saying/writing. Projects were fairly difficult but that's CS for ya. Also, exams were actually weighted relatively lightly compared to projects (each midterm was 12% of your grade and there were multiple projects worth 8% of your grade each). 

Overall, I would say that Anwar is a pretty solid choice for 330."""|4

"""Solid professor. Teaching seemed more oriented to the projects, while the notes from Cliff (co-teaching this class with him) helped more with exams. Sometimes was a bit disorganized when going through slides. Code demos were good. The grading was 40% projects, so very generous in terms of exam weight."""|4

"""Genuinely amazing professor. Taught the concepts really well and was also super open to any questions or related topics or even ways to do things that weren't originally part of the lecture. The class felt very interactive as a result, and, if you paid attention, you really got a lot out of it. In addition, Leo is also super easy to talk to about topics during or after class - and is generally just always very approachable. He's very enthusiastic about what he teaches and you can really tell. Class discussion was over Discord so you can get very quick feedback on any quick questions on the content or assignments. The projects were all really fun while remaining adequately challenging and workload was never too high. Leo made this probably my favorite class at UMD and I cannot recommend him highly enough."""|5

"""Amazing professor. Often grants extensions if he feels the class needs it, and ensures we understand the projects fully so that we are all successful. The midterm was really difficult, but projects are manageable so a good grade is definitely doable."""|5

"""An excellent professor who was extremely lax with assignments and whose lectures were concise and easy to follow. Homework assignments were based on lecture material and were generally easy to follow. The midterm was a bit nuanced but fair, and the final project was a gimme for the course. Awesome guy and appreciated the use of discord for class communication."""|5
